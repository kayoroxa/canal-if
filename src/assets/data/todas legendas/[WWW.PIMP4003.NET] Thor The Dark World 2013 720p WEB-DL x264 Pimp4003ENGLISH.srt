<i>Long before the birth
of light, there was darkness.</i>

came the Dark Elves.</i>

7
00:00:56,589 --> 00:00:59,091
<i>Such evil was possible</i>

8
00:00:59,093 --> 00:01:01,693
<i>through the power</i>
<i>of the Aether,</i>

9
00:01:01,695 --> 00:01:04,997

The forces of Asgard are upon us.

<i>As the Nine Worlds</i>

17
00:02:00,154 --> 00:02:04,323
<i>Malekith could at last</i>

18
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:19,838
Ahh!

19
00:02:22,843 --> 00:02:25,744
<i>But Asgard ripped</i>
<i>the weapon from his grasp.</i>

20
00:02:27,113 --> 00:02:29,014
<i>Without it,</i>

<i>With the battle all but lost,</i>

22
00:02:46,033 --> 00:02:49,201
<i>Malekith sacrificed</i>

Their death will mean our survival.

25
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,265
This war is far from over.

26
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:14,860
<i>Malekith was vanquished,</i>
<i>and the Aether was no more.</i>

27
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:17,863
<i>Or so we were led to believe.</i>

28
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:22,401
Sire, the Aether.
Shall we destroy it?

29
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:25,871
If only we could.

30
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:27,539
But its power is too great.

31
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:31,343
Bury it deep.

32
00:03:31,345 --> 00:03:33,478
Somewhere no one
will ever find it.

34
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:17,923
Hello, Mother.

35
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:20,692
Have I made you proud?

36
00:04:20,694 --> 00:04:23,262
Please, don't make this worse.

37
00:04:23,264 --> 00:04:24,930
Define "worse."

38
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:26,732
Enough!

39
00:04:26,734 --> 00:04:28,934
I will speak
to the prisoner alone.

40
00:04:43,317 --> 00:04:45,550
I really don't see
what all the fuss is about.

41
00:04:45,552 --> 00:04:49,154
Do you not truly feel
the gravity of your crimes?

42
00:04:49,156 --> 00:04:51,890
Wherever you go,
there is war, ruin,

43
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:54,660
and death.

44
00:04:54,662 --> 00:04:58,230
I went down to Midgard to rule the
people of Earth as a benevolent god.

45
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:01,333
Just like you.

46
00:05:01,335 --> 00:05:04,970
We are not gods.
We are born, we live, we die.

47
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:07,072
Just as humans do.

48
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:10,942
Give or take 5,000 years.

49
00:05:10,944 --> 00:05:14,613
All this because
Loki desires a throne.

50
00:05:14,615 --> 00:05:16,081
It is my birthright.

51
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:19,384
Your birthright was to die

52
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,320
as a child.

53
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:25,090
Cast out onto a frozen rock.

54
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,428
If I had not taken you in,

55
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:32,331
you would not be here
now to hate me.

56
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:34,966
If I am for the axe,
then for mercy's sake,

57
00:05:34,968 --> 00:05:37,536
just swing it.

58
00:05:37,538 --> 00:05:39,671
It's not that I don't love
our little talks,

59
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:41,073
it's just...

60
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:44,376
I don't love them.

61
00:05:44,378 --> 00:05:46,345
Frigga is the only reason
you're still alive,

62
00:05:46,347 --> 00:05:48,880
and you will never
see her again.

63
00:05:48,882 --> 00:05:52,718
You will spend the rest
of your days in the dungeons.

64
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:59,224
And what of Thor?

65
00:05:59,226 --> 00:06:02,828
You'll make that witless oaf
king while I rot in chains.

66
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:06,531
Thor must strive to undo
the damage you have done.

67
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,466
He will bring order
to the Nine Realms

68
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:09,701
and then, yes...

69
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:12,571
He will be king.

70
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:23,482
Ah!

71
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:02,287
I've got this
completely under control!

72
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:03,789
Is that why
everything is on fire?

73
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:20,038
Ah!

74
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,448
You're welcome.

00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:33,218
Ha!

76
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:52,637
All yours.

77
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:15,827
Hello.

78
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:21,132
I accept your surrender.

79
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:34,846
Anyone else?

80
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:46,458
Perhaps next time we should
start with the big one.

81
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:49,461
Keep moving. Come on!

82
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:03,823
Keep moving. Go ahead
of me. Don't you turn around!

83
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:07,078
Where do we go next?

84
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:12,150
Hogun, the peace is nearly
won across the Nine Realms.

85
00:09:12,152 --> 00:09:14,352
You should stay here.
Be with your people, where your heart is.

86
00:09:14,354 --> 00:09:15,887
Asgard can wait.

87
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:19,391
You have my thanks.

88
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:22,160
As you have mine.

89
00:09:26,532 --> 00:09:28,899
Heimdall, when you're ready.

00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:15,146
Is Vanaheim secure?

91
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:17,282
As are Nornheim and Ria.

92
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:19,884
Though our work would have gone
more quickly with you at the fore.

93
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:22,587
You must think
I'm a piece of bread

94
00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:24,956
that needs to be buttered
so heavily.

95
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:27,158
That was not my intent.

96
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,327
For the first time since
Bifrost was destroyed,

97
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:31,496
the Nine Realms are at peace.

98
00:10:31,498 --> 00:10:33,999
They're well reminded
of our strength

99
00:10:34,001 --> 00:10:35,800
and you have
earned their respect

100
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:38,670
and my gratitude.

101
00:10:38,672 --> 00:10:39,638
Thank you.

102
00:10:40,506 --> 00:10:42,774
Nothing out of order

103
00:10:42,776 --> 00:10:45,844
except your confused
and distracted heart.

104
00:10:45,846 --> 00:10:48,680
This isn't about Jane Foster,
Father.

105
00:10:48,682 --> 00:10:50,582
Human lives are fleeting,
they're nothing.

106
00:10:50,584 --> 00:10:52,624
You'd be better served by
what lies in front of you.

107
00:10:55,521 --> 00:10:56,788
I'm telling you this,
not as the Allfather,

108
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,023
but as your father.

109
00:10:58,025 --> 00:10:59,424
You are ready.

110
00:10:59,426 --> 00:11:01,292
The time has come
for you to take the throne.

111
00:11:01,294 --> 00:11:02,774
Embrace and celebrate
what you've won.

112
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:05,330
Join your warriors.

113
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:07,532
Eat and drink,
revel in their celebration.

114
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:10,869
At least pretend
to enjoy yourself.

115
00:11:55,848 --> 00:11:57,382
Another!

116
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:16,401
There was a time when you
would celebrate for weeks.

117
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:21,039
I remember you celebrated
the Battle of Harokin

118
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:23,942
so much that you nearly
started the second.

119
00:12:23,944 --> 00:12:25,844
Well, the first
was so much fun.

120
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:34,953
Take a drink with me.

121
00:12:34,955 --> 00:12:37,722
Surely, the Allfather could have
no further task for you tonight.

122
00:12:37,724 --> 00:12:39,524
No, this is one I set myself.

123
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:45,063
It does not go unnoticed
that you disappear each night.

124
00:12:45,065 --> 00:12:47,298
There are nine realms.

125
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:50,034
The future king of Asgard
must focus on more than one.

126
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,242
I thank you for your sword

127
00:12:57,244 --> 00:12:59,978
and for your counsel,
good Lady Sif.

128
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:21,633
Hi.

129
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:24,335
Hi.

130
00:13:24,337 --> 00:13:26,504
So, what's the story with you?

131
00:13:26,506 --> 00:13:28,573
Why does there have to be a story?
There's no story.

132
00:13:28,575 --> 00:13:31,009
You spent the first
ten minutes of our date

133
00:13:31,011 --> 00:13:33,511
hiding behind a menu
that has three choices on it.

134
00:13:33,513 --> 00:13:35,513
It's either chicken,
vegetarian, or fish, Jane.

135
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:37,682
I think there's a story

136
00:13:37,684 --> 00:13:40,585
and I'm thinking
the story involves a guy.

137
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:43,021
It's complicated.

138
00:13:43,023 --> 00:13:44,189
Is he still around?

139
00:13:44,191 --> 00:13:45,924
No, he...

140
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:48,026
Went away.

141
00:13:48,028 --> 00:13:49,694
I've been there.

142
00:13:49,696 --> 00:13:51,696
The going away.
It's hard, isn't it?

143
00:13:51,698 --> 00:13:53,531
I was seeing a woman

144
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:55,834
and she took a job in New York.

145
00:13:55,836 --> 00:13:57,969
Eventually,
the distance killed it.

146
00:13:57,971 --> 00:14:01,206
And the fact that she kept
sleeping with other dudes.

147
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:02,740
No!
Oh, so many.

148
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:07,278
Hi. Could we get some wine,
please?

149
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,379
Sure, I'd love some.

150
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:09,781
Richard, this is Darcy.

151
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:12,116
What are you doing here?

152
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:16,154
Oh. Hello.

153
00:14:16,156 --> 00:14:19,824
So, I show up to work at the
lab/your mom's house,

154
00:14:19,826 --> 00:14:23,561
fully expecting you to be
moping around in your pajamas,

155
00:14:23,563 --> 00:14:25,330
eating ice cream
and obsessing about...

156
00:14:25,332 --> 00:14:26,297
You know who.

157
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:27,966
Ah.

158
00:14:27,968 --> 00:14:30,301
But you're not.
You're wearing lady clothes.

159
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:31,803
You even showered, didn't you?
You smell good.

160
00:14:31,805 --> 00:14:33,238
Is there a point to all this?

161
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,039
Because there really needs
to be a point to all this.

162
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,208
Right.

163
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,770
You know all that scientific
equipment you don't look at anymore?

164
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,247
You might want to start
looking at it again.

165
00:14:42,249 --> 00:14:44,315
This is the reason
we came all the way out here.

166
00:14:44,317 --> 00:14:45,316
It's malfunctioning.

167
00:14:45,318 --> 00:14:46,484
That's what I said.

168
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:49,587
That's what I did.

169
00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:51,756
I thought you would do something
a little more scientific.

170
00:14:51,758 --> 00:14:53,324
I'm sure it's nothing.
Yeah, it's...

171
00:14:53,326 --> 00:14:54,859
It doesn't look like nothing.

172
00:14:54,861 --> 00:14:55,494
It kind of looks like the readings
that Erik was rambling about.

173
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:58,563
Our friend Erik

174
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:00,398
kind of went banana balls.

175
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,599
He's not interested.

176
00:15:01,601 --> 00:15:02,533
I'm not interested.
I'm interested.

177
00:15:02,535 --> 00:15:04,835
It's time for you to go now.

178
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:06,237
Okay.

179
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:10,775
Short but sweet.

180
00:15:10,777 --> 00:15:12,577
She needs help.

181
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:18,049
I think I'm going to have
the sea bass.

182
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:21,219
Sea bass, yeah.
Sea bass is good.

183
00:15:21,221 --> 00:15:25,356
Sea bass, sea bass, sea bass,
sea bass, sea bass, sea bass.

184
00:15:25,358 --> 00:15:27,859
Sea bass...

185
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,461
Sea bass.

186
00:15:30,463 --> 00:15:32,030
Jane?

187
00:15:32,032 --> 00:15:33,964
Maybe you should stop
saying "sea bass"

188
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:35,532
and go after your friend.

189
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:36,601
This was so fun.

190
00:15:37,803 --> 00:15:40,563
I'll just stay here
and say "sea bass" alone.

191
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:48,999
And I hate you.

192
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:51,482
What? I said he was cute.

193
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:53,484
Just shut up and drive.

194
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,929
You need to take the next left.

195
00:16:04,931 --> 00:16:07,298
Who's he?
He's my intern.

196
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,233
You have an intern?
Oh, yeah.

197
00:16:09,235 --> 00:16:11,502
Hello, Dr. Foster.

198
00:16:11,504 --> 00:16:13,471
It's such a great honor
to be working with you.

199
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:15,840
Right. I have to call Erik.

200
00:16:15,842 --> 00:16:17,342
Oh, take a right.

201
00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:20,144
And a left.

202
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:25,516
I have totally mastered
driving in London.

203
00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:29,620
Hi, Erik. It's me again.
Where are you?

204
00:16:29,622 --> 00:16:32,390
I came here because you said you were
onto something, and then you vanish.

205
00:16:32,392 --> 00:16:34,025
I'm here at Stonehenge

206
00:16:34,027 --> 00:16:37,261
for what has been an interesting
unfolding of events today.

207
00:16:37,263 --> 00:16:38,863
<i>The police were called</i>
<i>to the scene</i>

208
00:16:38,865 --> 00:16:40,631
<i>shortly after 11 A.M.</i>
<i>this morning</i>

209
00:16:40,633 --> 00:16:44,202
<i>after a seemingly harmless</i>
<i>rambler approached the area</i>

210
00:16:44,204 --> 00:16:47,171
<i>then, decided to strip naked</i>
<i>and effectively</i>

211
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:49,440
<i>terrorize tourists there</i>
<i>with scientific equipment</i>

212
00:16:49,442 --> 00:16:53,011
<i>whilst shouting that he was</i>
<i>trying to save them.</i>

213
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:56,647
<i>The man, later identified as noted
astrophysicist Dr. Erik Selvig</i>

214
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:58,950
<i>has been called in</i>
<i>for questioning by police.</i>

215
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:03,021
Come on, this is exciting.

216
00:17:03,722 --> 00:17:05,390
Look! The intern is excited.

217
00:17:05,392 --> 00:17:06,791
"Ian."

218
00:17:06,793 --> 00:17:08,326
Do you want the phase meter?

219
00:17:08,328 --> 00:17:09,794
- No.
- Bring the phase meter.

220
00:17:10,729 --> 00:17:12,063
The toaster-looking thing.

221
00:17:12,065 --> 00:17:14,298
I know what
the phase meter is.

222
00:17:22,242 --> 00:17:24,876
How do I change the ringtone
on this thing?

223
00:17:24,878 --> 00:17:26,844
An astrophysicist
with three degrees

224
00:17:26,846 --> 00:17:28,513
should be able
to change her own ringtone.

225
00:17:28,515 --> 00:17:29,914
Why are you calling me?

226
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:32,417
I didn't want to shout.
Intern says it's this way.

227
00:17:32,419 --> 00:17:33,551
"Ian." My name is Ian.

228
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:34,719
Shh.

229
00:17:48,334 --> 00:17:51,836
I am not getting stabbed
in the name of science.

230
00:17:51,838 --> 00:17:53,438
It's okay, we're Americans.

231
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,773
Is that supposed
to make them like us?

232
00:17:55,775 --> 00:17:57,336
- They'll make it go away.
- Shh.

233
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:01,512
Oh, they're kids.

234
00:18:01,514 --> 00:18:03,214
Are you the police?

235
00:18:03,216 --> 00:18:06,184
No, we're scientists.
Well, I am.

236
00:18:06,186 --> 00:18:07,418
Thanks.

237
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,020
We just found it.

238
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:12,356
Can you show us?

239
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:41,385
That doesn't seem right.

240
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,403
Where'd it go?

241
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:13,918
That's...

242
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,753
That's incredible!

243
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:31,202
What happened?

244
00:19:31,204 --> 00:19:32,703
Sometimes they come back.

245
00:19:32,705 --> 00:19:34,105
Sometimes they don't.

246
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,543
I want to throw something!

247
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:41,343
Jane, give me your shoe.

248
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:44,248
I haven't seen readings
like this since...

249
00:19:44,783 --> 00:19:45,950
Since...

250
00:19:45,952 --> 00:19:46,951
New Mexico?

251
00:19:51,623 --> 00:19:53,291
Don't touch anything!

252
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,929
Give me your shoe.

253
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:04,535
Oh.

254
00:20:18,917 --> 00:20:21,252
Were those the car keys?

255
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:51,315
Whoa. Ah!

256
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,118
Oh!

257
00:20:59,124 --> 00:21:00,124
Darcy!

258
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:48,406
Oh!

259
00:23:01,097 --> 00:23:03,999
[ ELVISH ]
The Aether awakens us.

260
00:23:04,009 --> 00:23:07,470
The Convergence returns.

261
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:23,267
You're late.

262
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:28,072
Merriment can sometimes be a
heavier burden than battle.

263
00:23:28,074 --> 00:23:29,714
Then you're doing
one of them incorrectly.

264
00:23:30,275 --> 00:23:32,543
Perhaps.

265
00:23:32,545 --> 00:23:34,412
How fare the stars?

266
00:23:34,414 --> 00:23:36,580
Still shining.

267
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:40,383
From here, I can see nine
realms and ten trillion souls.

268
00:23:44,222 --> 00:23:46,990
Do you recall what I taught
you of the Convergence?

269
00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:48,259
Yes.

270
00:23:48,261 --> 00:23:50,728
The alignment of the worlds.

271
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:52,630
It approaches, doesn't it?

272
00:23:52,632 --> 00:23:54,298
The universe
hasn't seen this marvel

273
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,467
since before my watch began.

274
00:23:57,636 --> 00:24:00,504
Few can sense it.
Even fewer can see it.

275
00:24:02,307 --> 00:24:04,542
But while its effects
can be dangerous,

276
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:08,212
it is truly beautiful.

277
00:24:09,648 --> 00:24:11,549
I see nothing.

278
00:24:11,551 --> 00:24:14,718
Or, perhaps, that is not
the beauty you seek.

279
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:22,326
How is she?

280
00:24:22,328 --> 00:24:24,161
She's quite clever,
your mortal.

281
00:24:24,163 --> 00:24:25,663
She doesn't know it yet,

282
00:24:25,665 --> 00:24:28,098
but she studies
the Convergence as well.

283
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,233
Even...

284
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:32,403
What?

285
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,674
I can't see her.

286
00:25:17,383 --> 00:25:18,616
Jane!

287
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:21,218
Where the hell were you?

288
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,820
Tell me you didn't
call the police.

289
00:25:22,822 --> 00:25:24,221
What was I supposed to do?

290
00:25:24,223 --> 00:25:25,823
Not call the police.
I was freaking out.

291
00:25:25,825 --> 00:25:27,725
You call the cops,
they call the Feds.

292
00:25:27,727 --> 00:25:29,326
Next thing you know, we have
S.H.I.E.L.D. crawling all over

293
00:25:29,328 --> 00:25:30,828
"Area 51-ing" the place.
Jane.

294
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:32,897
We had a stable
gravitation anomaly.

295
00:25:32,899 --> 00:25:34,698
We had unimpeded access.

296
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,167
Our only competition
was ten years old!

297
00:25:37,169 --> 00:25:38,530
Jane! You were gone
for five hours.

298
00:25:39,004 --> 00:25:40,404
What?

299
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:48,579
That's weird.

300
00:26:10,101 --> 00:26:11,669
Typical.

301
00:26:12,437 --> 00:26:12,937
Jane.

302
00:26:16,441 --> 00:26:19,276
Sorry. I just needed
to make sure you were real.

303
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:20,878
It's been a very strange day.

304
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,779
I am. Jane, what...

305
00:26:22,781 --> 00:26:23,914
Where were you?

306
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:24,782
Where were you?

307
00:26:26,117 --> 00:26:27,718
Heimdall cannot see you.

308
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,587
I was right here
where you left me.

309
00:26:29,589 --> 00:26:31,789
I was waiting,
and then I was crying

310
00:26:31,791 --> 00:26:33,357
and then I went out
looking for you.

311
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:35,259
You said you were coming back.

312
00:26:35,261 --> 00:26:37,761
I know. I know, but the
Bifrost was destroyed.

313
00:26:37,763 --> 00:26:39,463
The Nine Realms
erupted into chaos.

314
00:26:39,465 --> 00:26:42,066
Wars were raging,
marauders were pillaging.

315
00:26:42,068 --> 00:26:43,534
I had to put an end
to the slaughter.

316
00:26:45,403 --> 00:26:49,440
As excuses go,
it's not terrible.

317
00:26:49,442 --> 00:26:52,977
But I saw you on TV.
You were in New York!

318
00:26:52,979 --> 00:26:55,412
Jane, I fought to protect you
from the dangers of my world

319
00:26:55,414 --> 00:26:57,314
but I was wrong.

320
00:26:57,316 --> 00:26:59,316
I was a fool.

321
00:27:00,385 --> 00:27:03,554
But I believe that fate
brought us together.

322
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:07,491
Jane, I don't know
where you were,

323
00:27:07,493 --> 00:27:09,013
or what happened,
but I do know this...

324
00:27:09,761 --> 00:27:10,561
What?

325
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:12,830
I know...

326
00:27:14,232 --> 00:27:15,299
You do?

327
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:17,735
Do what?

328
00:27:18,503 --> 00:27:19,570
What?

329
00:27:20,171 --> 00:27:21,238
Hey!

330
00:27:22,907 --> 00:27:24,308
Is this you?

331
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,914
Uh, we're kind of in the
middle of something here.

332
00:27:30,916 --> 00:27:33,450
Um, I'm pretty sure
we are getting arrested.

333
00:27:33,452 --> 00:27:34,551
Hold that thought.

334
00:27:36,021 --> 00:27:39,790
Look at you, still all
muscly and everything.

335
00:27:39,792 --> 00:27:41,258
How's space?

336
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:43,494
Space is fine.

337
00:27:43,496 --> 00:27:45,262
Excuse me.

338
00:27:45,264 --> 00:27:46,363
Are you Jane Foster?
Yes.

339
00:27:46,365 --> 00:27:47,364
Do you know this man?

340
00:27:48,967 --> 00:27:49,833
He's my intern.

341
00:27:51,102 --> 00:27:52,836
My intern's intern.

342
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:55,205
This is private property and you're
trespassing, the lot of you.

343
00:27:55,207 --> 00:27:56,140
You'll have to come with me.

344
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:02,446
Jane.

345
00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:05,015
Jane.
Thor?

346
00:28:05,784 --> 00:28:06,717
Are you all right?

347
00:28:06,719 --> 00:28:08,719
What just happened?

348
00:28:08,721 --> 00:28:10,020
Place your
hands on your heads.

349
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:11,188
Step back.

350
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,589
This woman is unwell.

351
00:28:12,591 --> 00:28:13,757
She's dangerous.

352
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:15,459
So am I.

353
00:28:16,961 --> 00:28:19,229
Requesting armed response
officers to scene.

354
00:28:19,231 --> 00:28:20,631
Hold on to me.
What are you doing?

355
00:28:29,074 --> 00:28:31,041
Holy shit.

356
00:28:58,603 --> 00:29:00,504
We have to do that again.

357
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:01,972
Hi.

358
00:29:05,043 --> 00:29:06,910
Welcome to Asgard.

[ BLACK-ELVES' WORLD ]

360
00:29:28,977 --> 00:29:31,646
[ ELVISH ]
Look at my legacy, Algrim.

361
00:29:33,398 --> 00:29:36,191
I can barely remember a time
before the light.

362
00:29:36,526 --> 00:29:39,654
Our survival will be your legacy.

363
00:29:41,656 --> 00:29:45,368
The Asgardians will suffer
as we suffered.

364
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:46,703
I will recover the Ether.

365
00:29:46,745 --> 00:29:48,038
Restore our world.

366
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:50,874
And I will put an end to this
poisoned universe.

367
00:29:58,596 --> 00:29:59,797
What's that?

368
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:00,731
Be still.

369
00:30:08,506 --> 00:30:10,574
This is not of Earth.
What is it?

370
00:30:11,442 --> 00:30:14,478
We do not know.

371
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,714
But she will not survive the amount
of energy surging within her.

372
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:25,435
That's a quantum
field generator, isn't it?

373
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:28,125
It's a soul forge.

374
00:30:28,127 --> 00:30:30,888
Does a soul forge transfer molecular
energy from one place to another?

375
00:30:33,698 --> 00:30:35,699
Yes.

376
00:30:35,701 --> 00:30:37,141
Quantum field generator.

377
00:30:38,069 --> 00:30:39,770
My words are mere noises to you

378
00:30:39,772 --> 00:30:41,071
that you ignore them
completely?

379

She is ill.

00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:43,173
She is mortal.

381
00:30:44,709 --> 00:30:46,443
Illness is their
defining trait.

382
00:30:46,445 --> 00:30:47,978
I brought her here
because we can help her.

383
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:50,180
She does not belong
here in Asgard

384
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:53,383
any more than a goat
belongs at a banquet table.

385

Who do you think you are?

00:30:56,889 --> 00:30:59,623
I am Odin, King of Asgard.

I know very well who you are,
Jane Foster.

You told your dad about me?

392
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:11,802
Something is within her,
Father.

393
00:31:11,804 --> 00:31:13,136
Something I have
not seen before.

394
00:31:13,138 --> 00:31:14,671
Her world has its healers.

395
00:31:14,673 --> 00:31:16,673
They are called "doctors."
Let them deal with it.

396
00:31:16,675 --> 00:31:19,075

take her back to Midgard.

397
00:31:20,011 --> 00:31:21,245
No, I would not...

398
00:31:22,982 --> 00:31:24,414
touch her.

399
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:25,376
Jane, are you all right?

400
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:26,817
Yeah.

401
00:31:30,755 --> 00:31:31,955
It's impossible.

402
00:31:33,424 --> 00:31:35,926
The infection...
It's defending her.

403
00:31:36,527 --> 00:31:37,828
No.

404
00:31:38,429 --> 00:31:39,963
It's defending itself.

00:31:41,165 --> 00:31:43,400
Come with me.

406
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:47,437
There are relics that pre-date
the universe itself.

407
00:31:47,439 --> 00:31:50,974
What lies within her
appears to be one of them.

408
00:31:52,277 --> 00:31:54,678
The Nine Realms
are not eternal.

409
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,280
They had a dawn

410
00:31:56,282 --> 00:31:57,982
as they will have a dusk.

411
00:31:58,716 --> 00:31:59,850
But before that dawn

412
00:31:59,852 --> 00:32:02,452
the dark forces,
the Dark Elves,

413
00:32:02,454 --> 00:32:05,989

and unchallenged.

I know these stories.

417
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:16,934
Mother told them
to us as children.

418
00:32:16,936 --> 00:32:21,738
Their leader Malekith made a weapon out of
that darkness and it was called the Aether.

419
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:24,708
While the other relics
often appear as stones

420
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:27,444
the Aether is fluid
and everchanging.

421
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:29,947
It changes matter
into dark matter.

422
00:32:29,949 --> 00:32:31,982
It seeks out host bodies,

423
00:32:31,984 --> 00:32:33,550
drawing strength
from their life-force.

424
00:32:34,986 --> 00:32:38,088
Malekith sought to use
the Aether's power

425
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:42,559
to return the universe
to one of darkness.

426
00:32:42,561 --> 00:32:45,295

of bloodshed

The Aether was said to have
been destroyed with them,

00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:03,946
and yet here it is.

how to get it out of me?

No.

438
00:33:13,257 --> 00:33:14,758
It does not.

What of the lives
you took on Earth?

00:35:48,113 --> 00:35:49,813

You're always so perceptive
about everyone but yourself.

you knew I was in trouble.

The Nine Realms

orbiting Midgard much the way
your planets orbit the sun.

483
00:36:47,406 --> 00:36:51,575
And every 5,000 years,
the worlds align perfectly

484
00:36:51,577 --> 00:36:53,410
and we call this
the Convergence.

485
00:36:56,147 --> 00:37:00,217
During this time, the borders
between worlds become blurred.

486
00:37:00,219 --> 00:37:02,886
It's possible you found
one of these points.

487
00:37:05,089 --> 00:37:07,424
We are lucky
that it remained open.

488
00:37:07,426 --> 00:37:11,428
Once the worlds
pass out of alignment

489
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:14,998
then the connection is lost.

you explain things.

to save you, Jane.

know everything.

It's as if they resent
being imprisoned!

508
00:40:30,795 --> 00:40:33,229
There's no pleasing
some creatures.

Return to your cells, no
further harm will come to you.

You have my word.

Very well,
you do not have my word.

Send a squadron
to the weapons vault.

Defend it at all costs.
Secure the dungeon.

Go!

516
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:09,332
It's a skirmish.

517
00:41:09,334 --> 00:41:10,633
Nothing to fear.

518
00:41:10,635 --> 00:41:12,135
You've never been
a very good liar.

519
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:14,471
Take her
to your chambers.

00:41:14,473 --> 00:41:16,072
I'll come for you
when it's safe.

00:41:17,843 --> 00:41:19,943
Despite all I have survived,

my queen still worries over me.

524
00:41:22,681 --> 00:41:24,013
It's only because
I worry over you

525
00:41:24,015 --> 00:41:25,582
that you have survived.

526
00:41:28,085 --> 00:41:29,752
Listen to me now.

00:41:29,754 --> 00:41:32,856
I need you to do everything
I ask, no questions.

I am Malekith.

540
00:47:24,142 --> 00:47:26,609
And I would have what is mine.

541
00:47:38,889 --> 00:47:39,789
Ah!

542
00:47:57,574 --> 00:47:59,542
You have taken something,
child.

543
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:01,611
Give it back.

545
00:48:20,764 --> 00:48:22,498
Where is the Aether?

546
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:24,667
I'll never tell you.

547
00:48:25,602 --> 00:48:26,903
I believe you.

548
00:48:29,407 --> 00:48:31,173

Imagine... Imagine that
this is our world.

554
00:52:08,158 --> 00:52:10,459
Oh, thank you.
And this is another world.

555
00:52:10,461 --> 00:52:12,561
Normally, they're separate.

556
00:52:12,563 --> 00:52:14,263
But during the Alignment,

557
00:52:14,265 --> 00:52:18,134
everything is connected,
all nine realms.

558
00:52:18,136 --> 00:52:20,569
All nine realms

is crashing from one world

But if this happens to us now,

562
00:52:29,447 --> 00:52:31,947
the result will be cataclysmic.

This time, the Alignment

566
00:52:39,524 --> 00:52:42,424
and all the other worlds
would just pass us by.

567
00:52:42,426 --> 00:52:43,859
It's beautiful.

568
00:52:45,529 --> 00:52:47,396
It's simple. Any questions?

00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:51,534
Yeah.

Take care of yourself. We'll need
all your strength to recover Aether.

572
00:53:08,004 --> 00:53:12,358
And when you wake up,
we'll kill them all.

573
00:53:46,423 --> 00:53:47,456
Jane Foster?

574
00:53:49,259 --> 00:53:51,327
You need to come with us.

575
00:53:53,029 --> 00:53:56,165
We are still unable to restore
the palace shields.

576
00:53:56,167 --> 00:53:57,700
Our artillery
cannot detect them.

577
00:53:57,702 --> 00:53:59,968
Even Heimdall cannot see them.

578
00:54:02,872 --> 00:54:06,442
My king,
we are all but defenseless.

00:54:09,112 --> 00:54:10,996
She's your prisoner now?

00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:14,183
Leave us.

00:54:23,393 --> 00:54:25,327
I do not wish
to fight with you.

582
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:28,097
Nor I with you.

583
00:54:28,099 --> 00:54:29,932
But I intend
to pursue Malekith.

584
00:54:29,934 --> 00:54:31,055
We possess the Aether.

585
00:54:31,868 --> 00:54:33,269
Malekith will come to us.

586
00:54:33,271 --> 00:54:35,437
Yes, and he will destroy us.

587
00:54:35,439 --> 00:54:37,706
You overestimate
the power of these creatures.

588
00:54:37,708 --> 00:54:40,142
No, I value our people's lives.

589
00:54:40,144 --> 00:54:41,977
I'll take Jane
to the Dark World,

590
00:54:41,979 --> 00:54:43,379
and draw the enemy
away from Asgard.

591
00:54:44,214 --> 00:54:46,582
When Malekith
pulls the Aether from Jane,

592
00:54:46,584 --> 00:54:48,651
it will be exposed
and vulnerable.

593
00:54:48,653 --> 00:54:50,219
And I will destroy it and him.

If you fail,
you risk this weapon

falling into the hands
of our enemies.

596
00:54:57,295 --> 00:54:59,995
The risk is far greater
if we do nothing.

597
00:54:59,997 --> 00:55:01,930
His ship could be over
our heads right now,

598
00:55:01,932 --> 00:55:03,132
we would never even know it.

If and when he comes

600
00:55:05,002 --> 00:55:08,937
his men will fall
on 10,000 Asgardian blades.

601
00:55:08,939 --> 00:55:10,172
And how many of our men
shall fall on theirs?

602
00:55:10,174 --> 00:55:12,141
As many as are needed!

00:55:15,278 --> 00:55:16,412
Ah!

00:55:21,084 --> 00:55:22,518
We will fight!

605
00:55:25,355 --> 00:55:27,589
Till the last Asgardian breath.

606
00:55:28,692 --> 00:55:31,427
Till the last drop
of Asgardian blood.

607
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:36,999
Then how are you different
from Malekith?

608
00:55:40,303 --> 00:55:42,538
The difference, my son,
is that I will win.

609

It's a secret.

Hey, Erik, it's Darcy again.

he took Jane to Asgard,

614
00:56:09,166 --> 00:56:12,801

Your friend, Erik...

622
00:56:27,184 --> 00:56:28,617
What was his last name again?

623
00:56:29,753 --> 00:56:33,389
<i>And began shouting at visitors</i>
<i>to the historic site.</i>

624
00:56:33,391 --> 00:56:35,124

The Bifrost is closed
by your father's orders.

629

No one is to come

630
00:56:57,547 --> 00:56:58,880
or to go.

631
00:57:00,617 --> 00:57:03,352
We face an enemy that is
invisible even to me.

632
00:57:03,354 --> 00:57:06,688
What use is a guardian
such as that?

633
00:57:08,458 --> 00:57:11,093
Malekith will return,
you know this.

634
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:15,531
I need your help.

635
00:57:15,533 --> 00:57:19,067
I cannot overrule my king's
wishes. Not even for you.

636
00:57:19,069 --> 00:57:21,103
I'm not asking you to.

637
00:57:21,105 --> 00:57:23,605
The realms need their Allfather
strong and unchallenged

638
00:57:23,607 --> 00:57:26,141
whether he is or not.

639
00:57:26,143 --> 00:57:28,243
But he is blinded, Heimdall

640
00:57:28,245 --> 00:57:29,645
by hatred and by grief.

641
00:57:29,647 --> 00:57:31,313
As are we all.

642
00:57:31,315 --> 00:57:33,048

643
00:57:33,050 --> 00:57:34,783
The risks are too great.

644
00:57:34,785 --> 00:57:37,619
Everything we do
from here on is a risk.

645
00:57:37,621 --> 00:57:39,188
There is no other way.

646
00:57:43,226 --> 00:57:45,828

<i>of the highest order.</i>

00:57:49,433 --> 00:57:51,767
<i>Success will bring us exile</i>

650
00:57:51,769 --> 00:57:53,335
<i>and failure</i>

651
00:57:56,506 --> 00:57:58,941
<i>Malekith knew</i>

652
00:57:58,943 --> 00:58:01,176
<i>He can sense its power.</i>

653
00:58:01,178 --> 00:58:03,579
<i>If we do nothing,</i>
<i>he will come for it again</i>

654
00:58:03,581 --> 00:58:07,349
<i>but this time,</i>
<i>lay waste to all of Asgard.</i>

655
00:58:08,418 --> 00:58:10,619
We must move Jane off-world.

656
00:58:10,621 --> 00:58:12,588
The Bifrost has been shut down

657
00:58:12,590 --> 00:58:14,456
and the Tesseract
locked away in the vault.

658
00:58:14,458 --> 00:58:16,492
There are other paths
off Asgard.

659
00:58:16,494 --> 00:58:18,793
Ways known only to a few.

660
00:58:18,795 --> 00:58:20,262
One, actually.

661
00:58:22,365 --> 00:58:23,732
No.

662
00:58:28,538 --> 00:58:32,140
Thor. After all this time

663
00:58:32,142 --> 00:58:34,443
and now you come to visit me.

664
00:58:35,812 --> 00:58:36,879
Why?

665
00:58:38,448 --> 00:58:41,650
Have you come to gloat?
To mock?

666
00:58:41,652 --> 00:58:43,185
Loki, enough.

667
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:45,387
No more illusions.

668
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:54,596
Now you see me, brother.

669
00:59:03,406 --> 00:59:05,541
Did she suffer?

670
00:59:05,543 --> 00:59:08,010
I did not come here
to share our grief.

671
00:59:08,012 --> 00:59:10,996
Instead I offer you the chance
of a far richer sacrament.

672
00:59:12,148 --> 00:59:13,749
Go on.

673
00:59:13,751 --> 00:59:16,685
I know you seek
vengeance as much as I do.

674
00:59:16,687 --> 00:59:19,655
You help me escape Asgard
and I will grant it to you.

675
00:59:19,657 --> 00:59:21,256
Vengeance

676
00:59:21,258 --> 00:59:23,492
and afterward, this cell.

677
00:59:30,366 --> 00:59:33,068
You must be truly desperate

678
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:34,903
to come to me for help.

679
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:38,507
What makes you think
you can trust me?

680
00:59:38,509 --> 00:59:39,675
I don't.

681
00:59:41,711 --> 00:59:42,644
Mother did.

682
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:46,760
But you should know that when we
fought each other in the past,

683
00:59:47,450 --> 00:59:49,117
I did so with a glimmer of hope

684
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:50,879
that my brother was still
in there somewhere.

685
00:59:52,689 --> 00:59:54,656
That hope no longer exists
to protect you.

686
00:59:55,792 --> 00:59:58,860
You betray me,
and I will kill you.

687
01:00:01,631 --> 01:00:02,831
Hmm.

688
01:00:04,467 --> 01:00:06,401
When do we start?

689
01:00:06,403 --> 01:00:07,970
He will betray you.

690
01:00:07,972 --> 01:00:09,371
He will try.

691
01:00:14,143 --> 01:00:16,478
This is so unlike you, brother.

692
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:19,214
So clandestine.

693
01:00:19,216 --> 01:00:21,457
Are you sure you wouldn't
rather just punch your way out?

694
01:00:21,784 --> 01:00:23,986
If you keep speaking,
I just might.

695
01:00:23,988 --> 01:00:25,988
Fine. As you wish.

696
01:00:25,990 --> 01:00:26,822
I'm not even here.

697
01:00:28,257 --> 01:00:30,158
Is this better?

698
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:32,828
It's better company at least.

699
01:00:32,830 --> 01:00:36,398
Still, we could be
less conspicuous.

700
01:00:38,434 --> 01:00:40,402
Mmm, brother,
you look ravishing.

701
01:00:42,772 --> 01:00:45,607
It will hurt no less
when I kill you in this form.

702
01:00:45,609 --> 01:00:48,677
Very well. Perhaps you prefer
one of your new companions

703
01:00:48,679 --> 01:00:50,512
given that you seem
to like them so much.

704
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:53,081
Oh, this is much better.

705
01:00:53,083 --> 01:00:54,683
Ooh.

706
01:00:54,685 --> 01:00:57,352
The costume is a bit much.
So tight.

707
01:00:57,354 --> 01:00:58,954
But the confidence...

708
01:00:58,956 --> 01:01:02,024
I can feel
the righteousness surging.

709
01:01:02,026 --> 01:01:04,307
Hey, do you want to have a
rousing discussion about truth?

710
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:05,661
Honor? Patriotism?

711
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:06,828
God bless Amer...

712
01:01:09,198 --> 01:01:10,532
What?

713
01:01:15,538 --> 01:01:17,673
You could at least furnish
me with a weapon.

714
01:01:17,675 --> 01:01:19,541
My dagger, something.

715
01:01:25,149 --> 01:01:26,515
At last.

716
01:01:26,517 --> 01:01:28,350
A little common sense.

717
01:01:34,557 --> 01:01:37,726
And I thought you liked tricks.

718
01:01:37,728 --> 01:01:41,730
Well, what then? Your lovely mortal is
being guarded by a legion of Einherjar

719
01:01:41,732 --> 01:01:43,732
who will see you coming
from miles away.

720
01:01:43,734 --> 01:01:45,174
I won't be the one
who comes for her.

721
01:01:53,042 --> 01:01:54,309
I'm not hungry.

722
01:01:54,311 --> 01:01:55,477
What the...

723
01:01:56,479 --> 01:01:58,780
Good. Let's go.

724
01:02:04,253 --> 01:02:05,587
You're...

725
01:02:05,589 --> 01:02:06,950
I'm Loki,
you may have heard of me.

726
01:02:07,757 --> 01:02:09,091
That was for New York.

727
01:02:10,193 --> 01:02:12,094
I like her.

728
01:02:12,096 --> 01:02:13,995
<i>And what</i>
<i>of the Allfather?</i>

729
01:02:13,997 --> 01:02:16,231
It is my sworn duty
to notify him

730
01:02:16,233 --> 01:02:18,333
of crimes against the throne.

731
01:02:18,335 --> 01:02:21,670
You called me here
on an urgent matter.

732
01:02:22,438 --> 01:02:24,072
What is it?

733
01:02:24,074 --> 01:02:25,373
Treason, my lord.

734
01:02:25,375 --> 01:02:26,575
Whose?

735
01:02:27,276 --> 01:02:28,410
Mine.

736
01:02:29,512 --> 01:02:31,113
My king!

737
01:02:31,115 --> 01:02:32,681
The mortal has been taken.

738
01:02:36,619 --> 01:02:37,519
Stop Thor.

739
01:02:38,187 --> 01:02:39,755
By any means necessary.

740
01:02:42,525 --> 01:02:45,026
There they are! Take them.

741
01:02:45,028 --> 01:02:46,261
On my command.

742
01:02:46,263 --> 01:02:48,130
I'll hold them off.
Take her.

743
01:02:49,031 --> 01:02:50,432
Thank you.

744
01:02:53,269 --> 01:02:55,370
Betray him, and I'll kill you.

745
01:02:57,640 --> 01:03:00,108
It's good to see you, too, Sif.

746
01:03:05,982 --> 01:03:07,482
Assuming you can get
Loki's help

747
01:03:07,484 --> 01:03:10,318
and you can free this mortal

748
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:12,554
what good would it do?

749
01:03:12,556 --> 01:03:15,423
We'd all be dead the minute we
step one foot outside the palace.

750
01:03:15,425 --> 01:03:17,893
That, my friend, is why
we won't be leaving by foot.

751
01:03:22,398 --> 01:03:24,232
I will give you
as much time as I can.

752
01:03:24,234 --> 01:03:25,734
Thank you, my friend.

753
01:03:30,173 --> 01:03:32,541
If you even think
about betraying him...

754
01:03:33,276 --> 01:03:35,177
You'll kill me?

755
01:03:35,179 --> 01:03:36,912
Evidently,
there will be a line.

756
01:03:52,696 --> 01:03:54,830
I thought you said you knew
how to fly this thing.

757
01:03:54,832 --> 01:03:57,431
I said,
"How hard could it be?"

758
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:00,735
They're on the ship!

759
01:04:01,637 --> 01:04:03,038
Get to the ship!

760
01:04:06,777 --> 01:04:08,109
Well, whatever
you're doing, brother,

761
01:04:08,111 --> 01:04:09,144
I suggest you do it faster.

762
01:04:09,146 --> 01:04:10,145
Shut up, Loki.

763
01:04:12,982 --> 01:04:14,149
You must have missed something.

764
01:04:14,151 --> 01:04:15,350
No, I didn't.

765
01:04:15,352 --> 01:04:16,985
I'm pressing every button
on this thing.

766
01:04:16,987 --> 01:04:18,687
No, don't hit it.
Just press it gently.

767
01:04:18,689 --> 01:04:20,290
I'm pressing it gently,
it's not working!

768
01:04:23,393 --> 01:04:24,459
Ha, ha!

769
01:04:28,331 --> 01:04:29,631
Get him! Get him!

770
01:04:59,663 --> 01:05:01,103
I think you missed a column.
Shut up!

771
01:05:08,237 --> 01:05:09,571
Look, why don't you
let me take over?

772
01:05:09,573 --> 01:05:11,039
I'm clearly the better pilot.

773
01:05:11,041 --> 01:05:13,174
Is that right?
Well, out of the two of us,

774
01:05:13,176 --> 01:05:14,743
which one can actually fly?

775
01:05:25,087 --> 01:05:26,454
Oh, dear. Is she dead?

776
01:05:26,456 --> 01:05:27,589
Jane.

777
01:05:28,457 --> 01:05:29,257
I'm okay.

778
01:05:31,294 --> 01:05:32,193
Ah!

779
01:05:36,465 --> 01:05:37,832
Not a word.

780
01:05:40,136 --> 01:05:41,202
Now they're following us.

781
01:05:46,809 --> 01:05:48,243
Now they're firing at us.

782
01:05:48,245 --> 01:05:49,611
Yeah, thank you
for the commentary, Loki,

783
01:05:49,613 --> 01:05:50,734
it's not at all distracting!

784
01:05:55,318 --> 01:05:56,818
Well done.

785
01:05:56,820 --> 01:05:58,300
You just decapitated
your grandfather.

786
01:06:09,598 --> 01:06:10,899
You know, this is wonderful.

787
01:06:10,901 --> 01:06:13,435
This is a tremendous idea.

788
01:06:13,437 --> 01:06:15,270
Let's steal the biggest,

789
01:06:15,272 --> 01:06:16,638
most obvious ship
in the universe

790
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:17,906
and escape in that.

791
01:06:17,908 --> 01:06:19,507
Flying around the city,

792
01:06:19,509 --> 01:06:21,910
smashing into everything in
sight so everyone can see us.

793
01:06:21,912 --> 01:06:23,592
It's brilliant, Thor!
It's truly brilliant!

794
01:06:38,028 --> 01:06:39,828
I see your time in the dungeons

795
01:06:39,830 --> 01:06:42,097
has made you
no less graceful, Loki.

796
01:06:46,502 --> 01:06:48,269
You lied to me.

797
01:06:49,538 --> 01:06:51,106
I'm impressed.

798
01:06:51,108 --> 01:06:52,674
I'm glad you're pleased.

799
01:06:52,676 --> 01:06:53,875
Now, do as you promised.

800
01:06:53,877 --> 01:06:55,610
And take us
to your secret pathway.

801
01:07:18,734 --> 01:07:20,201
Fandral.
Right.

802
01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:24,973
For Asgard.

803
01:07:30,713 --> 01:07:31,813
Nothing personal, boys.

804
01:07:47,363 --> 01:07:48,930
Loki...

805
01:07:48,932 --> 01:07:52,267
If it were easy,
everyone would do it.

806
01:07:52,269 --> 01:07:53,902
Are you mad?
Possibly.

807
01:08:09,552 --> 01:08:11,019
Ta-da!

808
01:08:17,263 --> 01:08:20,600
[ ELVISH ]
We must strike now.

809
01:08:21,643 --> 01:08:22,602
No.

810
01:08:24,270 --> 01:08:29,901
Asgard no longer makes sense.

811
01:08:34,114 --> 01:08:36,032
The Aether has returned home.

812
01:08:51,561 --> 01:08:55,096
What I could do with the power
that flows through those veins.

813
01:08:55,098 --> 01:08:57,732
It would consume you.

814
01:08:58,734 --> 01:09:00,014
She's holding up
all right.

815
01:09:00,836 --> 01:09:02,837
For now.

816
01:09:02,839 --> 01:09:05,340
She's strong in ways
you'd never even know.

817
01:09:05,342 --> 01:09:06,374
Say goodbye.

818
01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:08,676
Not this day.

819
01:09:08,678 --> 01:09:11,212
This day, the next,
a hundred years, it's nothing.

820
01:09:12,648 --> 01:09:14,682
It's a heartbeat.

821
01:09:14,684 --> 01:09:17,185
You'll never be ready.

822
01:09:17,187 --> 01:09:19,500
The only woman
whose love you've prized

823
01:09:19,501 --> 01:09:20,622
will be snatched from you.

824
01:09:20,624 --> 01:09:22,023
And will that satisfy you?

825
01:09:22,025 --> 01:09:23,625
Satisfaction is not
in my nature.

826
01:09:23,627 --> 01:09:25,493
Surrender is not in mine.

827
01:09:26,662 --> 01:09:28,029
The son of Odin...
No.

828
01:09:28,031 --> 01:09:30,331
Not just of Odin.

829
01:09:30,333 --> 01:09:33,034
You think you alone
were loved of Mother?

830
01:09:33,036 --> 01:09:34,802
You had her tricks,
but I had her trust.

831
01:09:34,804 --> 01:09:36,104
Trust?

832
01:09:37,139 --> 01:09:38,406
Was that her last expression?

833
01:09:39,275 --> 01:09:41,776
Trust? When you let her die?

834
01:09:41,778 --> 01:09:43,344
What help were you
in your cell?

835
01:09:43,346 --> 01:09:44,646
Who put me there?

836
01:09:44,648 --> 01:09:45,847
Who put me there?

837
01:09:45,849 --> 01:09:46,848
You know damn well!

838
01:09:47,816 --> 01:09:49,217
You know damn well who!

839
01:09:55,724 --> 01:09:58,126
She wouldn't want us to fight.

840
01:09:59,895 --> 01:10:02,230
Well, she wouldn't
exactly be shocked.

841
01:10:06,736 --> 01:10:09,070
I wish I could trust you.

842
01:10:23,686 --> 01:10:25,486
Trust my rage.

843
01:10:32,761 --> 01:10:35,161
You'll have to sign for your
father's belongings, Mr. Selvig.

844
01:10:35,898 --> 01:10:36,965
What?

845
01:10:37,399 --> 01:10:38,933
Oh, yeah.

846
01:10:38,935 --> 01:10:41,402
My father,
Dr. Erik Selvig.

847
01:10:43,505 --> 01:10:45,907
One man's
leather wallet, brown.

848
01:10:45,909 --> 01:10:48,509
One key ring, three keys.

849
01:10:48,511 --> 01:10:50,144
Prescription medicine...

850
01:10:50,913 --> 01:10:52,146
Various.

851
01:10:54,883 --> 01:10:56,484
And...
Erik.

852
01:10:58,254 --> 01:10:59,687
These.
Yeah.

853
01:10:59,689 --> 01:11:00,989
Those.

854
01:11:01,457 --> 01:11:02,523
Thank goodness.

855
01:11:04,460 --> 01:11:05,460
Erik.

856
01:11:07,463 --> 01:11:08,630
Yes?

857
01:11:08,632 --> 01:11:10,531
It's, uh, Darcy.

858
01:11:10,533 --> 01:11:11,366
Darcy.

859
01:11:13,802 --> 01:11:15,637
So good to see you.

860
01:11:15,639 --> 01:11:16,938
Oh, I missed you, too.

861
01:11:16,940 --> 01:11:18,439
How did you find me?

862
01:11:18,441 --> 01:11:19,440
You were naked on TV.

863
01:11:21,143 --> 01:11:23,011
Okay, time to go, lots to do.

864
01:11:25,147 --> 01:11:27,115
Getting weird now.

865
01:11:28,784 --> 01:11:31,619
I should not be left in charge
of stuff like this.

866
01:11:31,621 --> 01:11:35,123
I don't get paid enough.
I don't get paid, period.

867
01:11:35,125 --> 01:11:38,226
I'm Ian by the way,
uh, Darcy's intern.

868
01:11:38,228 --> 01:11:40,061
Yeah, I don't get paid either.

869
01:11:40,996 --> 01:11:42,764
Are you all right?

870
01:11:42,766 --> 01:11:44,332
I've had a god in my brain.

871
01:11:46,001 --> 01:11:47,302
I don't recommend it.

872
01:11:49,171 --> 01:11:51,673
Dr. Selvig, sir,
your gear is beeping at me.

873
01:11:51,675 --> 01:11:53,841
It's happening.
It's sooner than I calculated.

874
01:11:53,843 --> 01:11:55,343
Wait. What's happening?

875
01:11:58,681 --> 01:12:00,648
Birds?

876
01:12:00,650 --> 01:12:02,283
Birds are happening?

877
01:12:02,285 --> 01:12:04,652
They're starlings.
It's called a murmuration.

878
01:12:04,654 --> 01:12:06,821
My dad, he used to take me
bird watching as a kid.

879
01:12:06,823 --> 01:12:08,156
Nerd.
Look!

880
01:12:13,629 --> 01:12:14,929
Where did they go?

881
01:12:27,843 --> 01:12:30,044
What the hell was that?

882
01:12:30,713 --> 01:12:32,547
Why are you smiling?

883
01:12:32,549 --> 01:12:33,881
There's nothing more reassuring

884
01:12:33,883 --> 01:12:36,684
than realizing that the world
is crazier than you are.

885
01:12:37,886 --> 01:12:39,387
Take me to Jane's lab.

886
01:12:52,835 --> 01:12:54,235
Jane.

887
01:13:00,876 --> 01:13:02,210
Malekith.

888
01:13:24,767 --> 01:13:26,567
All right.
Are you ready?

889
01:13:26,569 --> 01:13:27,668
I am.

890
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:43,684
You know, this plan of yours
is going to get us killed.

891
01:13:43,686 --> 01:13:45,420
Yes, possibly.

892
01:13:49,458 --> 01:13:50,779
You still don't
trust me, brother?

893
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:53,194
Would you?

894
01:14:02,137 --> 01:14:03,337
No, I wouldn't.

895
01:14:08,110 --> 01:14:09,544
Thor!

896
01:14:10,946 --> 01:14:12,046
No!

897
01:14:21,490 --> 01:14:24,292
You really think
I cared about Frigga?

898
01:14:24,294 --> 01:14:25,526
About any of you?

899
01:14:28,730 --> 01:14:29,530
All I ever wanted

900
01:14:31,133 --> 01:14:32,300
was you and Odin

901
01:14:32,302 --> 01:14:33,367
dead at my feet!

902
01:14:45,948 --> 01:14:46,848
Malekith!

903
01:14:49,117 --> 01:14:51,285
I am Loki of Jotunheim,

904
01:14:51,287 --> 01:14:52,353
and I bring you a gift.

905
01:14:55,324 --> 01:14:57,525
I ask only
one thing in return...

906
01:14:57,527 --> 01:15:00,428
A good seat from which
to watch Asgard burn.

907
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:03,961
[ ELVISH ]
He is an enemy of Asgard.

908
01:15:03,962 --> 01:15:06,756
He was their prisoner.

909
01:15:20,382 --> 01:15:21,516
Look at me.

910
01:16:19,875 --> 01:16:20,908
Loki! Now!

911
01:17:41,490 --> 01:17:42,590
Ah!

912
01:18:36,912 --> 01:18:37,778
Ah!

913
01:19:35,103 --> 01:19:36,137
Ah!

914
01:19:36,139 --> 01:19:37,738
No!

915
01:19:46,815 --> 01:19:49,150
See you in hell, monster.

916
01:20:07,836 --> 01:20:09,069
No. No, no, no.

917
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:13,974
Oh, you fool,
you didn't listen.

918
01:20:13,976 --> 01:20:14,742
I know...

919
01:20:16,077 --> 01:20:18,179
I'm a fool, I'm a fool.

920
01:20:18,181 --> 01:20:19,446
Stay with me, okay?

921
01:20:19,448 --> 01:20:20,581
I'm sorry.

922
01:20:22,651 --> 01:20:23,751
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

923
01:20:23,753 --> 01:20:25,019
Shh...

924
01:20:25,021 --> 01:20:26,053
It's okay.

925
01:20:29,991 --> 01:20:31,859
It's all right.

926
01:20:31,861 --> 01:20:34,028
I'll tell Father
what you did here today.

927
01:20:38,300 --> 01:20:40,935
I didn't do it for him.

928
01:20:49,845 --> 01:20:51,946
No!

929
01:21:45,867 --> 01:21:48,269
He's going to unleash it.

930
01:21:48,271 --> 01:21:50,604
Not just on Asgard,
or on a star.

931
01:21:50,606 --> 01:21:53,340
Malekith is going to
destroy everything.

932
01:21:53,342 --> 01:21:54,508
How?

933
01:21:55,410 --> 01:21:57,111
Jane, how?

934
01:21:57,113 --> 01:21:59,847
I saw him on Earth.
Why would he go to Earth?

935
01:22:00,615 --> 01:22:02,116
The Convergence.

936
01:22:02,118 --> 01:22:03,617
Oh, God.

937
01:22:03,619 --> 01:22:06,059
None of this would have happened
if I hadn't found the Aether.

938
01:22:06,788 --> 01:22:08,422
Then Malekith
would've only possessed it

939
01:22:08,424 --> 01:22:10,357
that much sooner.

940
01:22:10,359 --> 01:22:12,626
I only found it
because I was looking for you.

941
01:22:13,261 --> 01:22:14,528
Jane...

942
01:22:16,298 --> 01:22:17,798
Now we're trapped here.

943
01:22:24,372 --> 01:22:25,606
It's not me.

944
01:22:26,908 --> 01:22:28,375
Hello?

945
01:22:28,377 --> 01:22:29,643
<i>Hi, Jane, it's Richard.</i>

946
01:22:29,645 --> 01:22:31,478
Richard? Where are you?

947
01:22:31,480 --> 01:22:33,080
I'm still at the office.

948
01:22:33,082 --> 01:22:35,049
It's been a crazy day
here today.

949
01:22:35,051 --> 01:22:36,951
Oh, my God, this is amazing.
<i>Is it?</i>

950
01:22:36,953 --> 01:22:38,319
<i>I quite enjoyed our lunch</i>

951
01:22:38,321 --> 01:22:40,621
despite never actually
ordering anything.

952
01:22:40,623 --> 01:22:41,789
How am I getting service here?

953
01:22:41,791 --> 01:22:43,457
<i>Is this a bad time?
Do you want me to try you later?</i>

954
01:22:43,459 --> 01:22:45,826
No, no, no.
Please, whatever you do,

955
01:22:45,828 --> 01:22:47,161
do not hang up the phone.

956
01:22:48,229 --> 01:22:49,663
Okay, then.

957
01:22:49,665 --> 01:22:51,899
<i>I was just wondering</i>
<i>if you want to try again.</i>

958
01:22:51,901 --> 01:22:53,500
<i>Uh, maybe dinner next time.</i>

959
01:22:53,502 --> 01:22:55,269
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

960
01:22:55,271 --> 01:22:56,951
<i>Just stay on the phone, okay?</i>
<i>Yeah, I will.</i>

961
01:22:57,472 --> 01:22:58,439
Oh, my God.

962
01:23:03,511 --> 01:23:04,678
Am I interrupting something?

963
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:06,347
No, no, no. Nothing at all.

964
01:23:06,349 --> 01:23:07,815
Come on.

965
01:23:07,817 --> 01:23:08,682
<i>I'm losing you there.</i>
<i>Are you in a tunnel?</i>

966
01:23:08,684 --> 01:23:10,284
Where are we going?

967
01:23:10,286 --> 01:23:11,652
<i>Hello?</i>

968
01:23:11,654 --> 01:23:13,087
Why are there
so many shoes in here?

969
01:23:14,756 --> 01:23:16,590
I'll just text her.

970
01:23:28,871 --> 01:23:30,270
So, who's Richard?

971
01:23:30,272 --> 01:23:31,705
Really?

972
01:23:40,182 --> 01:23:41,882
Jane!
Hey.

973
01:23:41,884 --> 01:23:43,550
You can't just leave like that.

974
01:23:43,552 --> 01:23:45,152
The whole world is going crazy.

975
01:23:45,154 --> 01:23:46,475
All the stuff
we saw is spreading.

976
01:23:48,390 --> 01:23:49,957
Did you go to a party?
Erik?

977
01:23:50,558 --> 01:23:53,727
Jane! How wonderful.

978
01:23:54,629 --> 01:23:56,330
Oh!

979
01:23:56,332 --> 01:23:58,132
You've been to Asgard.
Where are your pants?

980
01:23:58,134 --> 01:24:00,234
Oh, he, uh...
He says it helps him think.

981
01:24:00,236 --> 01:24:01,969
Okay, well, I'm going to need
everything you got on this.

982
01:24:01,971 --> 01:24:04,338
All the work you've been doing on
gravimetric anomalies, everything.

983
01:24:04,340 --> 01:24:05,672
Okay.

984
01:24:05,674 --> 01:24:06,640
Are you well, Erik?

985
01:24:08,511 --> 01:24:09,791
Your brother's
not coming, is he?

986
01:24:10,678 --> 01:24:12,246
Loki is dead.

987
01:24:12,248 --> 01:24:13,080
Oh, thank God!

988
01:24:14,682 --> 01:24:16,383
I... I meant,
I'm so sorry.

989
01:24:16,751 --> 01:24:18,118
Thank you.

990
01:24:41,876 --> 01:24:43,744
Forgive me, my liege.

991
01:24:44,913 --> 01:24:47,014
I've returned from
the Dark World with news.

992
01:24:49,551 --> 01:24:51,452
Thor?

993
01:24:51,454 --> 01:24:55,422
There was no sign of Thor,
or the weapon, but...

994
01:24:57,459 --> 01:24:58,459
What?

995
01:25:01,696 --> 01:25:03,163
We found a body.

996
01:25:08,103 --> 01:25:09,036
Loki.

997
01:25:13,641 --> 01:25:15,576
Malekith is going to
fire the Aether at a spot

998
01:25:15,578 --> 01:25:17,611
where all the nine worlds
are connecting.

999
01:25:17,613 --> 01:25:20,080
Amplifying the weapon's impact.

1000
01:25:20,082 --> 01:25:21,582
For each additional world,

1001
01:25:21,584 --> 01:25:23,884
the power will
increase exponentially.

1002
01:25:23,886 --> 01:25:27,054
The effect would be universal.

1003
01:25:27,056 --> 01:25:28,722
But the Alignment
is only temporary.

1004
01:25:28,724 --> 01:25:31,825
He must be in exactly the
right place at the right time.

1005
01:25:31,827 --> 01:25:33,227
Well, how do we know
where that is?

1006
01:25:34,662 --> 01:25:37,331
We follow the directions.

1007
01:25:37,333 --> 01:25:38,499
This has happened before

1008
01:25:38,501 --> 01:25:40,000
thousands of years ago,

1009
01:25:40,002 --> 01:25:41,735
and the Ancients
were there to see it.

1010
01:25:42,670 --> 01:25:43,871
All the great constructions,

1011
01:25:44,973 --> 01:25:48,008
the Mayans, the Chinese,
the Egyptians.

1012
01:25:48,010 --> 01:25:51,478
They made use of the gravitational
effects of the Convergence.

1013
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:53,447
And they left us a map.

1014
01:25:53,449 --> 01:25:54,815
Stonehenge,

1015
01:25:56,117 --> 01:25:57,351
Snowdon,

1016
01:25:57,353 --> 01:25:58,685
the Great Orme.

1017
01:25:58,687 --> 01:26:00,220
These are all coordinates
taking us...

1018
01:26:01,623 --> 01:26:02,523
Here.

1019
01:26:05,460 --> 01:26:07,261
Greenwich?

1020
01:26:07,263 --> 01:26:09,930
The walls between worlds
will be almost non-existent.

1021
01:26:09,932 --> 01:26:11,131
Physics is going
to go ballistic.

1022
01:26:11,133 --> 01:26:12,933
Increases and decreases
in gravity,

1023
01:26:12,935 --> 01:26:14,668
spatial extrusions.

1024
01:26:14,670 --> 01:26:17,004
The very fabric of reality
is going to be torn apart.

1025
01:26:20,475 --> 01:26:22,442
I better get my pants.

1026
01:26:24,379 --> 01:26:25,879
Focus!
This is important.

1027
01:26:25,881 --> 01:26:27,548
We have to hammer them in
all around the site

1028
01:26:27,550 --> 01:26:29,983
and then Jane and Erik will
activate them from the tower.

1029
01:26:29,985 --> 01:26:31,885
They're taped together.

1030
01:26:31,887 --> 01:26:33,787
Do you even know
what these things do?

1031
01:26:34,222 --> 01:26:36,223
Uh... No.

1032
01:26:36,225 --> 01:26:37,291
Neither do I.

1033
01:26:42,230 --> 01:26:43,897
Shh!

1034
01:26:46,335 --> 01:26:47,935
Come on, come on, come on!
Right.

1035
01:27:00,748 --> 01:27:01,582
Holy...

1036
01:27:02,217 --> 01:27:03,116
Shit.

1037
01:27:15,430 --> 01:27:16,263
Ah!

1038
01:28:21,630 --> 01:28:24,131
You needn't have come
so far, Asgardian.

1039
01:28:24,133 --> 01:28:26,333
Death would've come to you
soon enough.

1040
01:28:26,335 --> 01:28:28,135
Not by your hand.

1041
01:28:28,137 --> 01:28:30,937
Your universe
was never meant to be.

1042
01:28:30,939 --> 01:28:33,774
Your world and your family

1043
01:28:33,776 --> 01:28:35,942
will be extinguished!

1044
01:28:38,313 --> 01:28:39,613
We're running
out of time.

1045
01:28:39,615 --> 01:28:40,947
Almost there.

1046
01:28:40,949 --> 01:28:42,649
Are you sure
this is going to work?

1047
01:28:42,651 --> 01:28:45,011
These devices were made to detect
anomalies, not cause them.

1048
01:28:45,653 --> 01:28:46,586
Oh, come on.

1049
01:28:51,959 --> 01:28:52,993
Come on, Darcy.

1050
01:29:04,806 --> 01:29:06,840
You know, with all that power,

1051
01:29:06,842 --> 01:29:08,108
I thought you'd hit harder.

1052
01:29:33,569 --> 01:29:34,534
Done.

1053
01:29:41,909 --> 01:29:44,745
The Convergence will be in
full effect in seven minutes.

1054
01:29:44,747 --> 01:29:46,713
That just means we have to
keep Malekith busy for eight.

1055
01:29:53,354 --> 01:29:55,114
Okay, you might want to
hold on to something.

1056
01:30:00,661 --> 01:30:02,229
That is awesome!

1057
01:30:02,231 --> 01:30:04,264
<i>How did you do that?</i>

1058
01:30:04,266 --> 01:30:08,001
Well, the gravitational fields interact with
the weak spots between worlds, creating...

1059
01:30:08,003 --> 01:30:09,243
Ooh, get the guy
with the sword!

1060
01:30:12,440 --> 01:30:14,174
Oops.
Let's go.

1061
01:30:14,176 --> 01:30:16,276
Um...

1062
01:30:16,278 --> 01:30:18,078
What the hell just happened?

1063
01:30:19,081 --> 01:30:20,514
Move!

1064
01:30:37,799 --> 01:30:39,132
What are you all doing?

1065
01:30:39,134 --> 01:30:41,034
You need to
get out of here, now!

1066
01:30:41,036 --> 01:30:42,269
You're joking, right?

1067
01:30:42,271 --> 01:30:43,570
That's Thor out there.

1068
01:30:43,572 --> 01:30:45,372
He's waving his hammer around
and everything!

1069
01:31:44,031 --> 01:31:45,599
Ah!

1070
01:32:04,118 --> 01:32:05,652
<i>Confirming ship is hostile.</i>

1071
01:32:05,654 --> 01:32:07,487
<i>Confirmed,</i>
<i>ship is hostile.</i>

1072
01:32:07,489 --> 01:32:08,989
<i>You have permission to engage.</i>

1073
01:32:08,991 --> 01:32:10,123
<i>Roger.</i>

1074
01:32:10,125 --> 01:32:11,291
<i>Missiles locked.</i>

1075
01:32:12,126 --> 01:32:13,793
<i>Missiles away.</i>

1076
01:32:15,363 --> 01:32:16,830
<i>Missiles off target.</i>

1077
01:32:16,832 --> 01:32:19,633
<i>I repeat, target missed.</i>
<i>I'm losing control.</i>

1078
01:32:19,635 --> 01:32:21,735
<i>Mayday! Mayday!</i>
<i>Lost positive control.</i>

1079
01:32:24,338 --> 01:32:25,472
What are you doing?

1080
01:32:25,474 --> 01:32:26,806
My signal's not connecting.

1081
01:32:29,143 --> 01:32:30,477
Jane!

1082
01:32:30,479 --> 01:32:31,444
Come on.

1083
01:33:13,789 --> 01:33:15,188
Are you all right?

1084
01:33:15,190 --> 01:33:16,189
You saved my life.

1085
01:33:19,795 --> 01:33:20,694
Yeah.

1086
01:33:21,195 --> 01:33:22,462
I guess I did.

1087
01:33:29,972 --> 01:33:30,804
Mmm.

1088
01:33:31,238 --> 01:33:32,772
Darcy?

1089
01:33:32,774 --> 01:33:33,807
Jane!

1090
01:33:33,809 --> 01:33:34,641
Ian!

1091
01:33:34,976 --> 01:33:35,875
Selvig!

1092
01:33:36,711 --> 01:33:38,944
Mew mew!

1093
01:33:41,717 --> 01:33:43,583
<i>Mind the gap.</i>

1094
01:33:45,621 --> 01:33:46,661
How do I get to Greenwich?

1095
01:33:47,755 --> 01:33:49,623
Take this train.
Three stops.

1096
01:33:51,826 --> 01:33:54,227
<i>Mind the gap.</i>

1097
01:33:56,230 --> 01:33:57,964
Sorry. Sorry.

1098
01:34:35,636 --> 01:34:37,270
We're out of time.
Jane.

1099
01:34:38,339 --> 01:34:39,506
Jane!

1100
01:35:05,399 --> 01:35:06,766
Thor!

1101
01:35:07,968 --> 01:35:09,169
We're too late.

1102
01:35:10,472 --> 01:35:12,405
The Convergence is at its peak.

1103
01:35:13,407 --> 01:35:14,474
Can those things stop him?

1104
01:35:14,476 --> 01:35:15,909
Not from here.

1105
01:35:15,911 --> 01:35:18,545
We can't get close enough.

1106
01:35:19,714 --> 01:35:20,780
I can.

1107
01:35:46,207 --> 01:35:47,006
Malekith!

1108
01:35:54,715 --> 01:35:58,218
Darkness returns, Asgardian.

1109
01:35:58,220 --> 01:36:01,788
Have you come to witness
the end of your universe?

1110
01:36:01,790 --> 01:36:03,356
I've come to accept
your surrender.

1111
01:36:23,144 --> 01:36:25,912
You think you can stop this?

1112
01:36:25,914 --> 01:36:28,782
The Aether cannot be destroyed.

1113
01:36:28,784 --> 01:36:30,383
But you can.

1114
01:37:16,463 --> 01:37:17,764
Thor! No.

1115
01:37:28,142 --> 01:37:29,042
Jane!

1116
01:37:50,865 --> 01:37:51,731
Ah!

1117
01:38:00,041 --> 01:38:01,541
Everybody okay?

1118
01:38:46,387 --> 01:38:47,954
He's gonna come back.

1119
01:38:50,557 --> 01:38:52,792
Except, you know,

1120
01:38:52,794 --> 01:38:55,295
last time he was gone for,
like, two years.

1121
01:38:55,297 --> 01:38:56,697
Well, it's only been
two days, so...

1122
01:38:58,966 --> 01:39:00,800
Did he say anything
before he left?

1123
01:39:00,802 --> 01:39:03,136
Yeah, he had to figure some
stuff out with his father.

1124
01:39:03,138 --> 01:39:06,873
He kinda committed treason...
On our way out.

1125
01:39:11,812 --> 01:39:12,779
Oh.

1126
01:39:15,883 --> 01:39:20,320
<i>You once said there would
never be a wiser king than me.</i>

1127
01:39:20,322 --> 01:39:22,155
<i>You were wrong.</i>

1128
01:39:22,157 --> 01:39:26,292
The Alignment has brought
all the realms together.

1129
01:39:26,294 --> 01:39:29,829
Every one of them saw you
offer your life to save them.

1130
01:39:29,831 --> 01:39:34,000
What can Asgard offer
its new king in return?

1131
01:39:35,269 --> 01:39:37,036
My life.

1132
01:39:38,505 --> 01:39:41,474
Father, I cannot
be king of Asgard.

1133
01:39:41,476 --> 01:39:44,110
I will protect Asgard
and all the realms

1134
01:39:44,112 --> 01:39:46,012
with my last and every breath,

1135
01:39:46,014 --> 01:39:48,915
but I cannot do so
from that chair.

1136
01:39:48,917 --> 01:39:52,318
Loki, for all his grave imbalance,
understood rule as I know I never will.

1137
01:39:53,821 --> 01:39:56,356
The brutality, the sacrifice...

1138
01:39:56,358 --> 01:39:58,358
It changes you.

1139
01:39:58,360 --> 01:40:02,261
I'd rather be a good man
than a great king.

1140
01:40:02,263 --> 01:40:06,966
Is this my son I hear,
or the woman he loves?

1141
01:40:06,968 --> 01:40:10,168
When you speak, do I
never hear Mother's voice?

1142
01:40:11,505 --> 01:40:14,340
This is not for Jane, Father.

1143
01:40:14,342 --> 01:40:17,176
She does not know
what I came here to say.

1144
01:40:17,178 --> 01:40:19,812
Now, forbid me to see her, or
say she can rule at my side.

1145
01:40:19,814 --> 01:40:22,015
It changes nothing.

1146
01:40:22,017 --> 01:40:25,051
One son who wanted
the throne too much,

1147
01:40:26,053 --> 01:40:28,087
another who will not take it.

1148
01:40:28,722 --> 01:40:30,723
Is this my legacy?

1149
01:40:30,725 --> 01:40:32,091
Loki died with honor.

1150
01:40:33,394 --> 01:40:34,660
I shall try to live the same.

1151
01:40:34,662 --> 01:40:35,962
Is that not legacy enough?

1152
01:40:47,241 --> 01:40:49,275
It belongs to you.

1153
01:40:50,310 --> 01:40:52,345
If you are worthy of it.

1154
01:40:52,347 --> 01:40:54,313
I shall try to be.

1155
01:40:55,983 --> 01:40:58,885
I cannot give you my blessing,

1156
01:40:58,887 --> 01:41:00,653
nor can I wish you
good fortune.

1157
01:41:01,488 --> 01:41:03,122
I know.

1158
01:41:06,260 --> 01:41:09,929
If I were proud of
the man my son had become,

1159
01:41:09,931 --> 01:41:12,131
even that, I could not say.

1160
01:41:15,269 --> 01:41:18,271
It would speak
only from my heart.

1161
01:41:19,706 --> 01:41:21,107
Go,

1162
01:41:22,242 --> 01:41:23,776
my son.

1163
01:41:25,946 --> 01:41:27,113
Thank you, Father.

1164
01:41:42,696 --> 01:41:43,763
No.

1165
01:41:45,232 --> 01:41:46,799
Thank you.

Thanks Luis-subs & dougsan

1167
01:44:04,838 --> 01:44:07,139
I present to you,

1168
01:44:08,008 --> 01:44:11,310
Taneleer Tivan, the Collector.

1169
01:44:12,779 --> 01:44:14,013
Whoa...

1170
01:44:17,451 --> 01:44:21,087
Asgardians, it's an honor.

1171
01:44:25,626 --> 01:44:27,426
You know why we're here.

1172
01:44:31,298 --> 01:44:33,099
Of course.

1173
01:44:33,967 --> 01:44:36,469
But, if I may ask,

1174
01:44:36,471 --> 01:44:40,473
why not keep it secure
in your own vault?

1175
01:44:40,475 --> 01:44:43,809
The Tesseract
is already on Asgard.

1176
01:44:43,811 --> 01:44:46,979
It is not wise to keep two
Infinity Stones so close together.

1177
01:44:47,748 --> 01:44:50,049
That's very wise.

1178
01:44:59,960 --> 01:45:01,227
I can assure you,

1179
01:45:02,829 --> 01:45:07,633
it will be
absolutely safe here,

1180
01:45:10,070 --> 01:45:12,405
in my collection.

1181
01:45:13,840 --> 01:45:16,075
See that it is.

1182
01:45:34,695 --> 01:45:37,096
One down.

1183
01:45:38,699 --> 01:45:41,100
Five to go.

1184
01:45:41,699 --> 01:45:46,100
