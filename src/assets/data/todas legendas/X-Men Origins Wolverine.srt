1
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,000
You're always sick.

2
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,500
You were sick when
you were my age.

3
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,400
Evening, sir.

4
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:02,700
Evening, Victor.

5
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,700
I didn't realise that
you're still here.

6
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,800
I'm just keeping
James company, sir.

7
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,500
If that's all right...

8
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,300
Very kind of you.

9
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,365
- Are you better, son?
- Still cold, father.

10
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,000
It's just a mild fever, you'll
be all right in the morning.

11
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,800
You always say that.

12
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,700
And you always pull
through, don't you?

13
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:30,100
Now... take your medicine.

14
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,900
Elizabeth.

15
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,565
Elizabeth.

16
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,565
Your father's drunk again.

17
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,900
You should help him home, Victor.

18
00:01:38,935 --> 00:01:41,200
It's not my name
he's calling, sir.

19
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,800
- Father.
- Stay where you are, James.

20
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,700
Father.

21
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,000
I told you never
to come back here.

22
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,565
James...

23
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,080
There are things you
don't understand.

24
00:02:24,085 --> 00:02:25,525
- Don't...
- I need him them to know.

25
00:02:25,535 --> 00:02:27,300
- Please no.
- No... more... lies.

26
00:02:27,335 --> 00:02:28,335
James...

27
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,800
James.

28
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,200
He wasn't your father...

29
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,200
son.

30
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,100
What are you?

31
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,800
- I didn't mean it. I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

32
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,900
He deserved it. And
you gave it to him.

33
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,700
We're brothers, Jimmy.
You realise that?

34
00:03:45,735 --> 00:03:47,800
Brothers protect each other.

35
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,865
You have to be hard now.

36
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:53,000
Hard enough they
can't ever touch us.

37
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,500
- I want to go home.
- We can't.

38
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,300
We stick together no matter what.

39
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,400
And take care of anyone
who gets in our way.

40
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,200
Can you do that, little brother?

41
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,600
They're coming. Can you run? Okay.

42
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,100
Keep on running. Don't look back.

43
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,700
Enough. Enough.

44
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,100
Stand down, soldier.

45
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,300
Victor.

46
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,600
Stand down.

47
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,600
No.

48
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,100
Ready.

49
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,600
Aim.

50
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,500
Wake me when it's over.

51
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,600
Fire.

52
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,465
My name is Major William Stryker.

53
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,900
You've been charged with
killing a senior officer.

54
00:07:59,935 --> 00:08:01,665
Is that correct?

55
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:04,100
Apparently we have some
issues with authority.

56
00:08:04,135 --> 00:08:05,300
Just keep a lid on it.

57
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,200
Sir.

58
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,240
The warden tells me that your
sentence was carried out...

59
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:12,525
by a firing squad at 1000 hours.

60
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,700
- How'd that go?
- It tickled.

61
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,365
You boys tired of running?

62
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,050
Tired of denying
your... true nature?

63
00:08:25,085 --> 00:08:27,700
- What do you care?
- Oh, I care...

64
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,600
I care cause I know how
special you are...

65
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,700
how valuable.

66
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:37,900
Look.

67
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:41,700
You can stay here, locked
up like freaks of nature...

68
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,500
or you can join me.

69
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,700
I'm putting together
a special team...

70
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,800
with special privileges.

71
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,200
Now tell me...

72
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,800
How would you like to
really serve your country?

73
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,200
I love this weapon more than
anything in the whole wide world.

74
00:09:11,235 --> 00:09:12,600
- You wanna know why?
- No.

75
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,500
It's memorable.

76
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,200
Sure, it's a little bulky, to
have to get 'em on a plane.

77
00:09:18,235 --> 00:09:19,700
You whip out a couple of swords...

78
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,950
at your ex-girlfriend's wedding...

79
00:09:21,985 --> 00:09:24,000
they will never, ever forget it.

80
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,500
That's funny, Wade.

81
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,000
I think you confused me with
someone who gives a shit.

82
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,500
Right, it is...

83
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,760
it's probably not as intimidating
as having a gun or...

84
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:36,500
bone claws or the fingernails
of a bag lady...

85
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:49,100
- Manicure?
- Victor... easy.

86
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,900
Fred got a new tattoo.
I'm concerned.

87
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,600
Oh geez, Fred, you just
met her last night.

88
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,900
- I love her.
- You love her after one night?

89
00:09:59,935 --> 00:10:02,500
She's a gymnast.

90
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,000
Bradley, take her down.

91
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,600
Are you gonna puke?

92
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,900
If we were meant to fly,
we'd have grown wings.

93
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,540
Oh, don't worry man. See, more
people die driving than flying.

94
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:18,740
How about from impaling?

95
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,200
Hey, be nice. Or be your
approximation of nice.

96
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,100
Would you like a bucket?

97
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,200
Gentlemen, wheels down
in Lagos in five.

98
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:07,900
- Why are we here?
- All in good time. Zero...

99
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,300
Intruder.

100
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,300
Man your weapons.

101
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:54,200
Having fun yet?

102
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,165
- Fred...
- The tank?

103
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,500
- Tank.
- Yeah, I got that.

104
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,200
Great.

105
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,200
Stuck in an elevator with five
guys on a high protein diet.

106
00:12:44,235 --> 00:12:46,117
- Oh Wade.
- Dreams really do come true.

107
00:12:46,152 --> 00:12:48,000
Would you just shut
it. You're up next.

108
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,300
Thank you, sir. You
look very nice today.

109
00:12:50,335 --> 00:12:51,365
It's the green.

110
00:12:51,366 --> 00:12:53,150
Brings out the seriousness
in your eyes.

111
00:12:53,185 --> 00:12:55,000
Oh my God, do you
ever shut up, pal?

112
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,800
No, not when I'm awake.

113
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:00,600
Bradley? Top floor, please.

114
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,500
Cover the elevator. The elevator.

115
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,900
Time to go to work.

116
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,700
Okay.

117
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,000
People are dead.

118
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,100
If you haven't that
mouth on you, Wade...

119
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,700
you'd be the perfect soldier.

120
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I wouldn't do that if
I were you, brother.

121
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,200
Take the diamonds, they're yours.

122
00:14:24,235 --> 00:14:25,700
I don't want your diamonds.

123
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,300
I want this.

124
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:32,665
That? That is nothing. A souvenir.

125
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:36,300
Where did you find it?
I want the source.

126
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:42,400
A small village, far inland,
three days from here.

127
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:48,000
Tell him that this rock is more
valuable to me than his life.

128
00:14:48,035 --> 00:14:49,400
Ask him where he found it.

129
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,300
He says it came from the sky.

130
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
He's telling the truth.

131
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,300
You don't know their
language, Logan.

132
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,900
It's a meteor fragment.

133
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,400
I know what it is.

134
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,000
I'm asking him where he found it.

135
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,900
Sir, base wants to
know our location.

136
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,200
Shut him down.

137
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,600
Tell him everyone here will die...

138
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:30,400
unless he tells me where
he found the rock.

139
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:44,000
- He said that is sacred.
- Okay, fine.

140
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,200
Victor...

141
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,500
Victor.

142
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,500
Don't even think about it.

143
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,800
We didn't sign up for this.

144
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,300
Put him down.

145
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,200
What are you doing?

146
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,499
We finally got a good
thing going here.

147
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,665
Don't you screw this up.

148
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,300
Enough, it's enough.
We've done enough.

149
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,600
Who do you think you are?

150
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,200
This is what we do.

151
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,665
Maybe you'd rather be
rotting in a hole somewhere

152
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,820
till they figure out a way
to do it to us, is that it?

153
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,700
I'm done.

154
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,500
You coming?

155
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,900
Jimmy.

156
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,400
We can't just let you walk away.

157
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,400
Jimmy.

158
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,700
Jimmy.

159
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,900
Why are you up so early?

160
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,200
Come here.

161
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,100
See you baby.

162
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,400
Hey.

163
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,100
Oh, that's nice. Yeah.

164
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,800
No. Come on.

165
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,700
Hey, what do you do?

166
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,900
You turn off the light,
you win a prize.

167
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,300
- Two tries for a buck.
- Come on, I wanna do it.

168
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,600
That's obvious.

169
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,400
That's two.

170
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:40,100
- That's a stupid trick.
- It's not a trick, man.

171
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,300
C'mon. Freak.

172
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,600
Bye.

173
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,100
Show's over.

174
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:23,800
I said, show's over.

175
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:31,400
The show is never
over for us, Bradley.

176
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,600
- Victor.
- Aren't you gonna invite me in?

177
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,900
Yeah, come on in.

178
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,640
You know, I've never
said anything...

179
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,100
to anyone... about what happened.

180
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,500
I'm living a totally
different life now, but.

181
00:22:01,535 --> 00:22:03,800
No need to bring up the past.

182
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,200
You know,

183
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:25,300
I always thought it would be
Wade coming knocking at my door.

184
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:31,500
Well, Wade's gone.

185
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,000
I'm not afraid of you, Victor.

186
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,100
I'm not afraid to die.

187
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:48,400
How do you know? You've
never tried it before.

188
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:08,600
Was it the wars?

189
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:13,200
- Which one?
- All of 'em.

190
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,100
Tell me.

191
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,600
It's just a scratch.

192
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:36,400
Looks like we're gonna need
new sheets again, baby.

193
00:23:36,435 --> 00:23:38,100
Yeah...

194
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,965
Who the hell is this?

195
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,200
It smells like government.

196
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:13,600
My God. Haven't aged a day.

197
00:24:13,635 --> 00:24:15,365
Clean living.

198
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,165
You remember Agent Zero.

199
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,900
Still shooting first and
asking questions later?

200
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:24,800
You still chewing
those cheap cigars?

201
00:24:24,835 --> 00:24:27,717
Boys, please. I
have a job for you.

202
00:24:27,752 --> 00:24:30,376
- I already have a job.
- Lumberjack.

203
00:24:30,411 --> 00:24:32,855
- Eighteen grand a year?
- Eighteen five.

204
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:35,195
Plus I haven't had to
kill anyone in a while.

205
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:37,500
- Start to miss it?
- Yeah, right now I am.

206
00:24:37,535 --> 00:24:40,400
Zero, back to the car.

207
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,400
Attaboy.

208
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:54,300
You know, I'm not proud about the
way things ended between us.

209
00:24:54,335 --> 00:24:56,200
Conversation's over.

210
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,600
Play the little house on
the prairie with a...

211
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,800
a school teacher.

212
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,000
That's just isn't you, Logan.

213
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,800
And you would know, huh?

214
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:06,900
I would.

215
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,400
What do you want, Stryker?

216
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,300
Bradley was killed three days ago.

217
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:16,465
Wade, before that.

218
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:19,700
I believe that someone is
hunting down our old team.

219
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,365
Anyone else?

220
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,200
As far as I know, Victor is safe.

221
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,240
Whoever it is, he's had
names, addresses...

222
00:25:29,242 --> 00:25:31,101
I can take care of myself.

223
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,300
This is not about you, Logan.

224
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,100
Your country needs you.

225
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,600
I'm Canadian.

226
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:47,700
I know you, Logan. I
know who you are.

227
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:27,300
What's wrong?

228
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,700
Stryker came by today.

229
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,565
Don't worry, I said no.

230
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,500
Why is he bothering you
after all these years?

231
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,300
Because I'm the best
there is at what I do.

232
00:26:39,335 --> 00:26:41,365
And what I do best
isn't very nice.

233
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,500
You're not an animal, Logan.
What you have is a gift.

234
00:26:44,535 --> 00:26:45,535
A gift?

235
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:48,600
You can return a gift.

236
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,800
Come on, fellas.

237
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:09,900
- Stay in the car.
- I'm just gonna ask nicely.

238
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,300
Mind letting us go by?

239
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,340
You're in some kind of
a hurry there, pal?

240
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:19,500
Are ya?

241
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,420
Just move your truck
so we can go by...

242
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,400
Trying to have a
conversation there, right.

243
00:27:23,435 --> 00:27:24,700
If you start something...

244
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,500
you'd better be
ready to finish it.

245
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,500
Hey guys, take it easy.

246
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,000
Calm down.

247
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,000
Your boyfriend's got a big mouth.

248
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,200
I know.

249
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:41,900
Big temper too, so
please, let us pass.

250
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,700
Thank you.

251
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,100
How did you do that?

252
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:55,100
You know, power of
persuasion is a gift.

253
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,700
I see, do you... have
those powers over me?

254
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,200
Well, you didn't stay
in the car, did you?

255
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:21,100
Why is the moon so lonely?

256
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,700
Why?

257
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,400
Because she used to have a lover.

258
00:28:26,435 --> 00:28:28,800
- You tell this to the kids?
- No.

259
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,300
His name was Kuekuatsheu...

260
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,220
and they lived in the
spirit world together.

261
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,300
- Ah, it's a true story.
- Right.

262
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,700
And every night, they would
wander the skies together.

263
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:44,800
But... one of the other
spirits was jealous.

264
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:48,365
Trickster, one of the
moons from South,

265
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:52,500
so he told Kuekuatsheu that the
moon had asked for flowers.

266
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,600
He told him to come
to our world...

267
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,600
and pick up some wild roses...

268
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,400
But Kuekuatsheu didn't know...

269
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,700
that once you leave
the spirit world...

270
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,265
you can never go back.

271
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:07,100
And every night, he
looks up in the sky...

272
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:10,500
and sees the moon
and howls her name.

273
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:14,900
But...

274
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,900
he can never touch her again.

275
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:25,200
Koo-koo-Kachooka got screwed.

276
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,500
Kuekuatsheu.

277
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:38,600
Means the Wolverine.

278
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
What you're doing, Logan?

279
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,900
Kayla.

280
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:43,100
You're not from
around here, are you?

281
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,700
What gave me away?

282
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,900
You got insurance on this place?

283
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,500
Insurance?

284
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:59,100
No.

285
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,700
Too bad.

286
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,000
Victor.

287
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:20,300
Well, well, well... Look
what the cat dragged in.

288
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:23,700
Guys, whatever this
is, take it outside.

289
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,900
- Why?
- Why?

290
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,665
You don't call, you don't write.

291
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:50,500
How else am I supposed
to get your attention?

292
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,200
I hate to say it, Jimmy.

293
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,800
But, frankly, I'm a
little disappointed.

294
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,900
Stay down.

295
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,100
Tell me something,
Jimmy, was she worth it?

296
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,900
When are you gonna figure it out?

297
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:44,100
We're not like them.

298
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,600
I... am nothing like you.

299
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,700
Sure you are.

300
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:55,200
You just don't know it yet.

301
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,750
What do we got?

302
00:36:08,752 --> 00:36:10,701
Bar fight. Multiple knife wounds.

303
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,500
What? Is this a joke?
The guy's fine.

304
00:36:15,535 --> 00:36:16,899
Where is he?

305
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:17,900
I said where is he.

306
00:36:17,935 --> 00:36:18,935
I don't know who he is.

307
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,900
I can help you.

308
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,900
Six years I've been here.

309
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:31,600
No one knew me and
then you show up.

310
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:35,000
- And the next day, she's dead.
- I tried to warn you.

311
00:36:35,035 --> 00:36:36,700
Why don't you tell
me it was Victor?

312
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,100
I didn't know.

313
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:45,500
I swear on my son's
life. I didn't...

314
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,865
Victor's appetites were
becoming too public.

315
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:58,400
I had to lock him up. He
thought I'd betrayed him.

316
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,900
Went AWOL.

317
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:02,700
He said he was coming
after all of us.

318
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,600
You didn't come to warn me.

319
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,500
You came to save your own ass.

320
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,265
So what's your plan, captain?

321
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,100
You can't beat him, Logan,
you know you can't.

322
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,200
I'm gonna find him and kill him.

323
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,100
I can give you the
tools to defeat him.

324
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:26,500
- So we can still save the others.
- You mean save yourself, right?

325
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,665
I promise you two things:

326
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:32,900
You'll suffer more pain than
any other man can endure,

327
00:37:32,935 --> 00:37:35,400
but you'll have your revenge.

328
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:41,600
If I come with you,
I'm coming for blood.

329
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:45,800
No law, no code of conduct.

330
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:48,150
You point me in the
right direction

331
00:37:48,151 --> 00:37:50,200
and you get the
hell out of my way.

332
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
When it starts,

333
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:34,600
whatever the reason is
that you're doing this,

334
00:38:34,635 --> 00:38:37,567
focus on that. Maybe it will help.

335
00:38:37,602 --> 00:38:40,500
Trust me, I've been through worse.

336
00:38:40,535 --> 00:38:42,000
No, you haven't.

337
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:44,400
We're ready.

338
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,400
We're gonna make you
indestructible.

339
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:51,500
But first, we're gonna
have to destroy you.

340
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:57,934
Remember what we were
looking for in Africa?

341
00:38:57,935 --> 00:38:58,935
I remember.

342
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Well, I found it.

343
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,265
It helped us create a...
metal compound so strong

344
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:09,300
that you will be able to
withstand virtually anything.

345
00:39:09,335 --> 00:39:12,100
It's called Adamantium.

346
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,100
I can't put Victor
down myself, Logan.

347
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:21,800
To kill him, you're gonna have
to embrace the other side.

348
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:25,500
Become the animal.

349
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,900
Let's do this.

350
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,000
I almost forgot.

351
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:36,400
I want new ones.

352
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,600
What do you want them to say?

353
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,900
Wolverine.

354
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:02,100
Generals. Welcome.

355
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,100
General Munson.

356
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:08,400
Today, we're gonna
witness medical history.

357
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,075
Today, we're gonna
create Weapon X.

358
00:40:11,076 --> 00:40:12,076
X?

359
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,100
Roman numeral, Ten.

360
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:21,600
We are about to begin bonding
Adamantium to Weapon X's skeleton.

361
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:23,600
Let's begin.

362
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,200
- We're brothers, Jimmy.
- Logan.

363
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:14,800
Body temperature is
1-0-8 and rising.

364
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:20,500
Why is he thrashing like
that? Why isn't he sedated?

365
00:41:20,535 --> 00:41:22,200
He feels pain, just
like the rest of us.

366
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,065
Anaesthesia won't work on him.

367
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:26,100
- That's why he had to volunteer.
- Heart rate 190.

368
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:28,100
195.

369
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:30,000
- Will he survive this?
- I don't know.

370
00:41:30,035 --> 00:41:31,700
200.

371
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:35,200
Son.

372
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:38,165
Heartbeat's well beyond maximum.

373
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,700
- Blood pressure?
- 260 over 180 and rising.

374
00:41:40,735 --> 00:41:43,200
He can make it, he can make it.

375
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,200
Victor.

376
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,365
I love you.

377
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,500
You're not an animal, Logan.

378
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:06,100
It means... the Wolverine.

379
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,000
Well, I guess he can die.

380
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:08,800
Come on, old friend. Come back.

381
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:13,200
Heart rate rising.

382
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,200
Adamantium reservoir is depleted.

383
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:20,800
No rejection. Procedure completed.

384
00:43:20,835 --> 00:43:22,300
We did it.

385
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,600
We did it.

386
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:32,100
We take him to the island?

387
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:35,200
The island? No.

388
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,600
The bonding works.

389
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,900
We use his DNA for the XI.

390
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,300
Erase his memory.

391
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,400
Erase his memory.

392
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,400
I think he heard you.

393
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:18,800
Lockdown.

394
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:58,900
Hunt him down. Take his head off.

395
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:41,900
Travis.

396
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:53,200
I think there is a
naked man in the barn.

397
00:45:53,235 --> 00:45:54,235
Yep.

398
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:28,400
Son...

399
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:30,400
What in hell are you doing?

400
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:34,200
- It's cold.
- Cold?

401
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:42,300
- You got no clothes on.
- Yeah.

402
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:44,400
You're not onto drugs, are you?

403
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:45,700
No.

404
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,400
You just had a rough night.

405
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:50,700
Yeah, you could say that.

406
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:55,500
Come on up the house.

407
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:59,000
Some of my son's old clothes
will probably fit you.

408
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:02,300
Here, cover it up with that.

409
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:05,700
I don't want to give an
old lady a heart attack.

410
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:52,900
You're alright in there?

411
00:47:52,935 --> 00:47:54,500
Yeah, I'm fine.

412
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,300
Supper's on the table.

413
00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:00,100
I... Yeah, I'll be
there in a minute.

414
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:13,800
I swear I'm gonna pay for it.

415
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,400
Set it down over there.

416
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:24,200
Come and sit down, son.

417
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:33,065
I can't thank you both
enough... for everything.

418
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:35,900
It wouldn't have been decent to
leave you out there to freeze.

419
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:39,300
- Decent...
- What?

420
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:43,400
Nothing, I'm just not
really used to that word.

421
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:47,880
That's a nice chopper
you've got out there.

422
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:49,400
You know motorcycle?

423
00:48:49,435 --> 00:48:50,965
Oh Lord, here we go.

424
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,300
My favourite is a '48 Panhead.

425
00:48:52,335 --> 00:48:53,565
I bought one new off the line.

426
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:56,365
I think you're a little
young for that, son.

427
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:59,600
You must be exhausted. You
get a good night's sleep.

428
00:48:59,635 --> 00:49:01,500
In the barn.

429
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:04,600
Nothing you can break out there.

430
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:23,400
- Why is the moon so lonely?
- Why?

431
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:27,500
Because she used to have a lover.

432
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:32,200
He can never touch her again.

433
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:52,600
You sleep ok?

434
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:56,000
Yeah.

435
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:02,400
You look like a man
fixing to do a bad thing.

436
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,600
You know what happens to
many looking for blood?

437
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,800
- What?
- They find it.

438
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:18,100
- We all got a choice, son.
- Yeah, mine got taken.

439
00:50:18,135 --> 00:50:20,100
Bullshit.

440
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:26,200
This was my son's jacket.

441
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:29,700
Try it on.

442
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:49,200
- Thank you.
- Yep...

443
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:54,700
You wanna take my bike for a
spin, test the suspension.

444
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:58,000
'64, huh?

445
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:01,300
Man, you're heavy.

446
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:04,000
Yeah, I put on a little
weight recently.

447
00:51:04,035 --> 00:51:05,035
Good morning.

448
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:06,300
Good morning.

449
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:11,800
Oh, it fits you beautifully.

450
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:14,600
I brought you some...

451
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:26,400
Weapon X is in the barn. He
just murdered two civilians.

452
00:51:26,435 --> 00:51:29,700
Blow him to bits. Let's see
if he can survive that.

453
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:56,000
Come and get me.

454
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,200
Blow his brains all over the road.

455
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:11,900
Damn.

456
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:50,000
Alpha One, do not lose him.

457
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:00,500
Alpha 2, target's coming to you.

458
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,900
Pull up.

459
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:46,200
Zero?

460
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:50,700
Zero, come in.

461
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:55,400
Zero.

462
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:02,800
Zero, is Logan dead?

463
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:04,500
I don't know, I'm down.

464
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:09,800
Zero, is Logan dead?

465
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:16,400
Zero, come in.

466
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:22,600
You tried to kill me.

467
00:55:23,099 --> 00:55:24,099
Logan?

468
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:25,650
Where is Victor?

469
00:55:25,685 --> 00:55:27,200
Come back to base.

470
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:29,640
I'll explain everything, we'll
take Victor down together.

471
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:31,065
Wrong answer.

472
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:33,800
After I've killed Victor,
I'm coming for you.

473
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:38,565
Logan, listen to me.

474
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:41,200
If you go down this road, you're
not gonna like what you find.

475
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:44,700
You wanted the animal, Colonel?

476
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:46,500
You got it.

477
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,600
Those were good people back there.

478
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:56,000
Innocent people.

479
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:07,900
It's funny how good innocent
people tend to die around you.

480
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,365
Zero never stood a chance.

481
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:36,300
The only thing that'll take him
down is an Adamantium bullet.

482
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:46,600
This facility is
compromised. Prep transport.

483
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:57,500
Colonel, this is turning
into a disaster.

484
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,900
- Don't worry, we'll stop him.
- Really?

485
00:56:59,935 --> 00:57:01,800
You've just spent half
a billion dollars...

486
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,500
making him indestructible.

487
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:07,600
- Sir?
- Yes.

488
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:11,300
The young mutant you've been
looking for, we found him.

489
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:13,800
General, Logan isn't the
only piece in this puzzle.

490
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:15,900
I need to evacuate this facility.

491
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:18,500
Please, go back to Washington.

492
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:20,000
We've got work to do.

493
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:26,800
You talk, el habla?

494
00:57:26,835 --> 00:57:28,400
Somebody translate?

495
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:30,500
Summers?

496
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:33,400
Sit up and take off those glasses.

497
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:36,800
I have a headache.

498
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:39,750
Then you can wear them in
detention after school

499
00:57:39,785 --> 00:57:42,300
while you add up this
conjugation 100 times.

500
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:44,765
- Somebody else?
- He talks.

501
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:47,000
Thank you, he talks. El habla.

502
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:00,800
- You sure it was Victor?
- Yeah.

503
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:03,000
Damn.

504
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:06,100
I'm sorry, mate.

505
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:10,800
What the hell happened
to him after I left?

506
00:58:10,835 --> 00:58:11,835
He got worse.

507
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:14,100
He felt like you abandoned him.

508
00:58:14,135 --> 00:58:15,965
Hell, we all do.

509
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:19,350
But Victor, he had to prove
you he was better than you.

510
00:58:19,385 --> 00:58:22,700
Hunting and killing everything's
he was pointing at.

511
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:27,100
Quit a few months later myself,
couldn't take rounding them up.

512
00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:30,900
- Rounding who up?
- Leave it alone.

513
00:58:30,935 --> 00:58:32,900
Rounding who up, John?

514
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:35,465
Hey. God damn it, John.

515
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:37,900
We hunted our own kind, Logan.

516
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:40,700
There's a special place in
hell for the things we did.

517
00:58:40,735 --> 00:58:41,735
Mutants?

518
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:44,400
Why?

519
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:47,200
Stryker'd say we would
be making a difference.

520
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:50,200
Protecting people
from the bad ones.

521
00:58:58,100 --> 00:59:00,600
How are you gonna take
Victor down, Logan?

522
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:02,700
Remember that stuff in Africa?

523
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:04,800
Yeah, I remember
Africa, what about it?

524
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,300
Damn.

525
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:13,300
What'd they do to you?

526
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:15,300
Don't ask.

527
00:59:17,900 --> 00:59:19,620
Listen, Zero said something
about an island.

528
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:21,200
Does that mean anything to you?

529
00:59:21,235 --> 00:59:22,265
Nope.

530
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:23,865
But maybe Dukes knows.

531
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:26,100
- Him and Zero were real tight.
- Fred Dukes?

532
00:59:26,135 --> 00:59:27,365
- Where is he?
- He's here.

533
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:29,400
- Well, let's go talk to him.
- Hold on.

534
00:59:29,435 --> 00:59:31,300
He don't get in until around four.

535
00:59:31,335 --> 00:59:32,500
But I gotta warn you...

536
00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:34,600
he developed a bit
of eating disorder.

537
00:59:34,635 --> 00:59:36,300
We all got our coping mechanisms.

538
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:38,300
I'm trying to whoop
him back into shape.

539
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:41,380
Whatever you do, don't
mention his weight.

540
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:45,400
Come on, Fred, if you want to get
into shape, you gotta move, man.

541
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:46,585
I told him he got to move.

542
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:54,120
Fred Dukes? Trapped inside that
creature? That ain't Fred Dukes.

543
00:59:54,135 --> 00:59:56,400
Hey, be nice.

544
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:00,000
Hey, Fat, Fred.

545
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:03,600
See, I remember that girl when
she's got 85 pounds, huh.

546
01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:08,700
Oh that's funny. You're
still so funny, Logan.

547
01:00:08,735 --> 01:00:11,400
You know where Victor is?

548
01:00:11,435 --> 01:00:12,465
No idea.

549
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:14,700
What's the island, slim?

550
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:18,900
Don't let the door hit you
on the way out, Logan.

551
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:21,640
Listen, I ain't gonna leave until
you tell me where Victor is.

552
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:23,825
Come on, Bob. For old
times' sake, huh?

553
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:26,900
Did you just call me...

554
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:29,800
Blob?

555
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:32,600
No, but...

556
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:39,840
I told you not to
mention his weight.

557
01:00:39,860 --> 01:00:41,100
Why did you call him Blob?

558
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:43,700
I didn't call him
Blob, I said Bob.

559
01:00:43,735 --> 01:00:45,500
Goddamn it.

560
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:47,300
I got an idea.

561
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,520
- This is your idea of an idea?
- Trying to help you out, Logan.

562
01:00:51,555 --> 01:00:53,435
Dukes don't like you that
much, and you know it.

563
01:00:53,455 --> 01:00:54,565
The feeling is mutual.

564
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:57,100
Use those gloves, man, dance
with him a little bit.

565
01:00:57,135 --> 01:00:59,300
Allow him to let his
anger out on you.

566
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:00,840
I figure if you do that...

567
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:02,700
he might tell you
everything you wanna know.

568
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:04,665
Come on, man, look at him.

569
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:07,200
Big old ass coming out of
the front of his shirt.

570
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:09,800
Jesus, he's gonna have a
coronary for Christ's sake.

571
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,520
Is there even a
stretcher big enough...

572
01:01:11,540 --> 01:01:13,140
to take this guy out of here?

573
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:16,881
It ain't him I'm worried about
getting out on a stretcher.

574
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,480
- You're an asshole.
- Come on, Logan.

575
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:22,665
Whoop his ass.

576
01:01:22,666 --> 01:01:24,700
- If you want.
- Dance with him Fred.

577
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:28,000
What's that suppose to do?
You wanna dance with me?

578
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:29,900
Oh. Oh, that feels good.

579
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:35,700
Hey, guess what?

580
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:38,000
See, he's gonna talk, man.

581
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:39,640
You got him right
where you want him.

582
01:01:39,660 --> 01:01:41,225
Whose side are you on anyway?

583
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:44,000
Come on now, lambchop.

584
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:18,200
Now, where is Victor?

585
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,800
A little dark for sunglasses,
don't you think?

586
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:10,400
Please don't. Please.
Don't, please.

587
01:03:10,435 --> 01:03:12,100
Victor.

588
01:03:16,700 --> 01:03:18,400
Hey. Where's Victor?

589
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:24,400
Victor's... with Stryker
on... on the island...

590
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:27,100
they... they run it together.

591
01:03:29,100 --> 01:03:30,100
What... what?

592
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:32,300
Victor's been with Stryker?

593
01:03:32,335 --> 01:03:33,800
Yeah.

594
01:03:34,100 --> 01:03:35,500
You didn't know that?

595
01:03:56,300 --> 01:03:58,300
All that's left now is Logan, I...

596
01:03:58,335 --> 01:04:01,500
trust you can handle that.

597
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,150
I did before, didn't I?

598
01:04:04,185 --> 01:04:06,300
Oh yes, you did that.

599
01:04:08,900 --> 01:04:13,300
Our deal... it still
applies, right?

600
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:15,665
Of course.

601
01:04:15,700 --> 01:04:18,500
Now pack him and tag him, Captain.

602
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:28,665
What's the island?

603
01:04:28,700 --> 01:04:33,800
It's where... Striker takes
them after Victor's caught 'em.

604
01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:37,200
Wait, wait... what? Takes who?

605
01:04:38,300 --> 01:04:40,200
Mutants.

606
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:45,300
The rumour is that Stryker's
doing experiments on them there.

607
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:49,900
Well, you never wondered
what happened to them?

608
01:04:49,935 --> 01:04:52,300
I tried not to.

609
01:05:08,100 --> 01:05:09,100
They killed her...

610
01:05:09,101 --> 01:05:12,900
so I'd let them put
Adamantium in me.

611
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:17,500
They killed her for a
goddamn experiment.

612
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:23,565
Where is it?

613
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:26,500
Logan, Stryker kept
it real secret.

614
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:31,500
But...

615
01:05:33,300 --> 01:05:35,800
- A prisoner escaped there once.
- Who?

616
01:05:35,835 --> 01:05:36,865
His name is Remy LeBeau.

617
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:39,200
He was a street hustler
from New Orleans.

618
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:42,333
The guards at the prison
called him Gambit

619
01:05:42,334 --> 01:05:44,099
because he kept taking all
their money at poker...

620
01:05:44,100 --> 01:05:45,165
that's all I know.

621
01:05:45,166 --> 01:05:47,400
What's Stryker up to Fred,
what's the end game?

622
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:54,000
He's taking their powers,
trying to combine them somehow.

623
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:56,800
It's all I know, Logan.
It's all I know.

624
01:05:58,100 --> 01:06:01,200
If I had to come back here,
I'm gonna take your head off.

625
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:07,000
I'm coming with you, Logan.

626
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,807
There's no redemption
where I'm going.

627
01:06:10,808 --> 01:06:11,808
I ain't asking.

628
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:51,000
There's our dude.

629
01:06:57,600 --> 01:06:59,200
That's cool.

630
01:06:59,700 --> 01:07:01,900
But I'm going to go and
cover the back if he runs.

631
01:07:01,935 --> 01:07:03,215
I'm not having a fight with him.

632
01:07:03,235 --> 01:07:04,865
- Yeah right.
- What?

633
01:07:04,900 --> 01:07:06,300
I am having fights with everybody?

634
01:07:06,335 --> 01:07:08,365
Don't dogs kill cats?

635
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:10,500
Just go cover the back, will ya?

636
01:07:22,900 --> 01:07:25,700
Are you Remy LeBeau?

637
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,600
Do I owe you money?

638
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:30,100
No.

639
01:07:31,100 --> 01:07:33,200
Then Remy LeBeau I am.

640
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:54,500
Large blind is 100, and
the small blind's 50.

641
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:57,265
May I deal you in?

642
01:07:57,300 --> 01:07:59,500
Now what can I get for 17 bucks?

643
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:02,500
17 dollars?

644
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:05,200
A cab ride home, perhaps.

645
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:12,200
You're my brother's
new babysitter, John?

646
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:15,165
I ain't Bradley, Victor.

647
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:17,100
And your creepy black
coat don't scare me.

648
01:08:17,135 --> 01:08:18,600
Really?

649
01:08:18,900 --> 01:08:20,100
It worked on Dukes.

650
01:08:20,900 --> 01:08:23,140
Shouldn't had done that, because
now I'm gonna kill you...

651
01:08:23,160 --> 01:08:24,560
before Logan gets the chance.

652
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:28,300
So what brings you to
our fair city, sir?

653
01:08:28,335 --> 01:08:30,400
Victor Creed.

654
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:33,800
And who's that?

655
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:36,800
The man I'm gonna kill.

656
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:41,500
He works for a man named
Stryker on, on an island.

657
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:45,800
- I just need to know where it is.
- Why would you think I know that?

658
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:48,400
Well, because I know
who you are, Gambit.

659
01:08:49,900 --> 01:08:51,400
You are the guy who escaped...

660
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:54,200
and you are the guy who's
gonna take me back there.

661
01:08:56,100 --> 01:08:57,765
You know, John...

662
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:59,900
There's something I always
wanted to tell you.

663
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:07,900
You're predictable.

664
01:09:11,700 --> 01:09:14,200
I can feel your spine, Johnny Boy.

665
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:18,100
That's funny. I never
knew you had one.

666
01:09:21,300 --> 01:09:25,100
Those are mighty nice tags
you have on there, sir.

667
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:29,300
The men who took me wore
tags just like 'em.

668
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:34,800
Hey, now Bob, you listen to me...

669
01:10:08,300 --> 01:10:09,900
Two years I was rotting
in that hell...

670
01:10:10,100 --> 01:10:12,300
and I'm never going back.

671
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,600
Oh, shiny.

672
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:21,800
Tell me something, Jimmy.

673
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:25,000
Do you even know how to kill me?

674
01:10:25,035 --> 01:10:27,400
I'm gonna cut your
goddamn head off.

675
01:10:28,300 --> 01:10:30,300
See if that works.

676
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,600
You're getting slow, old man.

677
01:10:51,100 --> 01:10:53,400
Son of a bitch.

678
01:10:56,900 --> 01:10:59,500
You're gonna die for
what you did to her.

679
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:25,200
Victor.

680
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:36,800
That's a nice stick.

681
01:12:35,900 --> 01:12:37,900
Shithead. Here's the deal.

682
01:12:38,100 --> 01:12:40,660
See, you're gonna take me to this
island, where I can kill Creed,

683
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:43,200
Stryker, pretty much everyone
you hate in this world.

684
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:45,100
Do you understand?

685
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:47,765
You really gonna kill 'em.

686
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:50,300
As long as you stay
out of my way, yeah.

687
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:05,700
Colonel.

688
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:07,865
General?

689
01:13:07,900 --> 01:13:10,400
Is this Weapon XI?

690
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:14,800
All their strenghts but
none of their weaknesses.

691
01:13:14,835 --> 01:13:16,900
You really hate them, don't you?

692
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:18,800
No, I don't hate them.

693
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:20,680
After 20 years of
working with them...

694
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:22,600
I just know what they can do.

695
01:13:27,300 --> 01:13:28,780
If we win this war
before it starts...

696
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:31,265
it'll save countless
lives in the process.

697
01:13:31,300 --> 01:13:34,500
Preemptive action is the
only action here, General.

698
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:39,200
The days of our country sitting
on the sidelines are over.

699
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:41,500
We need to take the
fight to the enemy...

700
01:13:41,700 --> 01:13:43,300
before they take the fight to us.

701
01:13:43,900 --> 01:13:46,800
- I admire your passion, I do.
- Thank you.

702
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:50,400
But this is as far as it goes.

703
01:13:50,700 --> 01:13:52,750
Weapon X was a... a hickup.

704
01:13:52,785 --> 01:13:54,800
We know about your son, Bill.

705
01:13:54,835 --> 01:13:56,565
We know he's a mutant.

706
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:58,200
And we know he killed your wife.

707
01:13:58,400 --> 01:13:59,840
You shouldn't have
kept that from us.

708
01:13:59,860 --> 01:14:01,425
That...

709
01:14:03,100 --> 01:14:05,000
That has nothing to
do with my work.

710
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:06,200
Bullshit.

711
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:09,800
You're too close to this.
I'm sure you know it.

712
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:15,600
You're right. I won't lie to you.

713
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:23,600
My son did bring the
problem home for me.

714
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,600
But I took an oath...

715
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:30,100
to protect the American people

716
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:32,600
from every threat,

717
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:34,600
both foreign

718
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:43,200
and domestic.

719
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:52,800
- You don't like flying, huh?
- I'm fine.

720
01:14:52,835 --> 01:14:54,465
Just concentrate on
what you're doing.

721
01:14:54,500 --> 01:14:56,300
You sure? You got a bit of
sweat on your brow there.

722
01:14:56,335 --> 01:14:58,000
Very funny, just keep
your eyes on the...

723
01:14:58,200 --> 01:14:59,500
On the what? Clouds?

724
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:02,100
We're jumping up and down
like a freaking yoyo here.

725
01:15:02,135 --> 01:15:03,535
Where did you get
this thing anyway?

726
01:15:03,555 --> 01:15:05,600
Oh, this is my baby,
I won her in a game.

727
01:15:05,635 --> 01:15:08,700
- Jacks over fives.
- Great.

728
01:15:09,900 --> 01:15:12,400
Relax. We're almost there.

729
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:17,200
There it is. The island.

730
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:20,900
Three Mile Island.
Hiding in plain sight.

731
01:15:23,900 --> 01:15:26,500
No one's gonna snoop
around a nuclear reactor.

732
01:15:26,535 --> 01:15:29,100
They think it's gonna
turn them into freaks.

733
01:15:29,135 --> 01:15:30,617
Like you?

734
01:15:30,652 --> 01:15:32,100
Right.

735
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:35,265
All right, you ready?

736
01:15:35,300 --> 01:15:36,900
Because it's now or
never. Let's go.

737
01:15:36,935 --> 01:15:38,300
About time.

738
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:49,100
Hey, if it's make you
feel any better...

739
01:15:49,400 --> 01:15:50,565
this is really gonna hurt.

740
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:54,300
Well yeah, it kind
of does actually.

741
01:15:54,900 --> 01:15:56,300
Good luck.

742
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:58,400
Likewise.

743
01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:01,700
Oh shit.

744
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:09,800
How are you doing?

745
01:16:10,300 --> 01:16:11,800
Is everything alright?

746
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:15,300
- Is he ready yet?
- A few more hours.

747
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:17,700
And he will respond
to my commands?

748
01:16:17,735 --> 01:16:19,700
Absolutely.

749
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:23,400
Logan.

750
01:17:24,700 --> 01:17:26,500
Welcome back to the war.

751
01:17:27,900 --> 01:17:31,200
Before I gut you,
I wanna know why.

752
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:34,700
I needed your powers for the pool.

753
01:17:34,735 --> 01:17:36,465
For the what?

754
01:17:36,500 --> 01:17:39,800
A mutant killer. The dead pool.

755
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:42,900
Years of searching, to find...

756
01:17:43,100 --> 01:17:44,365
finding the right powers...

757
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:49,200
that can coexist in one body
without ripping it apart.

758
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:54,100
My son was the first
piece of the puzzle.

759
01:17:54,900 --> 01:17:56,900
Logan, you were the last.

760
01:17:57,400 --> 01:17:59,100
You made Weapon XI possible.

761
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:01,600
I...

762
01:18:01,900 --> 01:18:03,200
I asked you to help but...

763
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:07,700
you said you wanted
the quiet life.

764
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,000
Well...

765
01:18:09,900 --> 01:18:11,900
I've learned that
nothing motivates...

766
01:18:12,100 --> 01:18:15,700
the men in your
family like revenge.

767
01:18:32,300 --> 01:18:34,000
Who are you?

768
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:37,400
Oh she's a real old friend.

769
01:18:48,900 --> 01:18:51,000
Do you really think we'd
just let you walk away?

770
01:18:52,200 --> 01:18:54,700
You are a dangerous man.

771
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,600
I like to keep an eye
on dangerous men.

772
01:18:57,900 --> 01:19:00,000
Tell him about the day you died.

773
01:19:06,100 --> 01:19:09,300
They gave me a shot of
hydrochloride thiazide.

774
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:13,500
It reduces the heart
rate so low...

775
01:19:13,700 --> 01:19:15,300
it appears you flatline.

776
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,500
Don't be angry with her.

777
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:33,400
Real credit... to your species.

778
01:19:36,100 --> 01:19:37,700
Did you know that her sister...

779
01:19:37,900 --> 01:19:40,165
has diamond-hard skin?

780
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:43,765
Kayla's mutation
is tacto-hypnosis.

781
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:46,800
She can influence people as
long as she touches them.

782
01:19:46,835 --> 01:19:49,600
Quite a useful tool
in the seduction.

783
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:52,400
It was never real, my friend.

784
01:19:57,200 --> 01:19:59,400
It was real for me.

785
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:02,760
I told you if you came
down this road...

786
01:20:02,900 --> 01:20:04,500
you wouldn't like
what you'd found.

787
01:20:11,900 --> 01:20:13,965
That story you told me...

788
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:17,500
about man who gets
flowers for the moon...

789
01:20:18,700 --> 01:20:21,600
I had it backwards.

790
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:27,200
I thought you were the moon
and I was your Wolverine.

791
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:32,600
But you were the
Trickster, aren't you?

792
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:35,300
I am just the fool
that got played.

793
01:20:37,300 --> 01:20:40,800
The worst part of this
is I should have known.

794
01:20:43,400 --> 01:20:46,000
But I ignored my instincts.

795
01:20:48,900 --> 01:20:51,900
I ignored what I really am.

796
01:20:56,200 --> 01:20:59,100
Well, that will
never happen again.

797
01:21:30,100 --> 01:21:32,165
- Colonel.
- Not now, Kayla.

798
01:21:32,200 --> 01:21:35,100
I have done everything
you've asked.

799
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:38,200
My sister...

800
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:41,100
You said that if I help
you, you'd let her go.

801
01:21:41,700 --> 01:21:43,665
Kayla, it's not as simple as that.

802
01:21:43,700 --> 01:21:46,565
Her mutation is unique.
Quite beautiful.

803
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:48,900
We just need a little more time
to analyse it, that's all.

804
01:21:48,935 --> 01:21:50,000
You let him go?

805
01:21:53,800 --> 01:21:56,165
- Victor, please.
- You can't let him go.

806
01:21:56,200 --> 01:21:58,700
- You can't beat him, Victor.
- Give me the Adamantium.

807
01:21:58,735 --> 01:22:00,467
- Tests came out...
- We had a deal.

808
01:22:00,502 --> 01:22:02,200
You would never survive
the operation.

809
01:22:04,700 --> 01:22:06,000
I can take anything he can.

810
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:07,800
No, you can't.

811
01:22:08,900 --> 01:22:10,340
You are my favourite
soldier, Victor.

812
01:22:10,900 --> 01:22:12,500
Be patient, time will come.

813
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:13,900
He's using us.

814
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:27,300
How about this time,
you die for real?

815
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:29,200
Let me go.

816
01:22:32,100 --> 01:22:34,500
Your little mind game
don't work on me.

817
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:36,200
Victor.

818
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:12,400
Feels good, doesn't it?

819
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:15,800
All that rage...

820
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:18,600
Do it.

821
01:23:18,635 --> 01:23:20,200
Logan.

822
01:23:21,300 --> 01:23:22,400
You're not an animal.

823
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:25,400
Oh yes, you are.

824
01:23:28,900 --> 01:23:30,100
Do it.

825
01:23:34,100 --> 01:23:36,300
Finish it.

826
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:01,400
Logan?

827
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:06,700
My sister.

828
01:24:06,900 --> 01:24:08,300
They have my sister.

829
01:24:09,500 --> 01:24:12,100
Please, I didn't trick
you into loving me.

830
01:24:12,900 --> 01:24:14,400
It was real for me too.

831
01:24:17,700 --> 01:24:20,000
Please, I'm so sorry.

832
01:24:20,035 --> 01:24:22,300
They have my sister.

833
01:24:22,700 --> 01:24:24,300
Where is she?

834
01:24:29,500 --> 01:24:31,100
Activate Weapon XI.

835
01:24:31,300 --> 01:24:32,660
The bonding process is incomplete.

836
01:24:32,680 --> 01:24:34,600
Just do it. Now.

837
01:25:36,300 --> 01:25:38,000
Are you okay? Come on.

838
01:26:29,800 --> 01:26:31,100
Okay...

839
01:26:32,700 --> 01:26:33,900
Perfect.

840
01:26:34,200 --> 01:26:35,580
Kayla, get these kids out of here.

841
01:26:35,581 --> 01:26:36,581
Logan...

842
01:26:36,582 --> 01:26:37,967
Find another way out.

843
01:26:38,002 --> 01:26:40,200
Come on, let's go.

844
01:26:41,200 --> 01:26:43,200
Wade, is that you?

845
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:50,000
I guess Stryker finally figured
out how to shut you up.

846
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:01,800
Wade...

847
01:27:03,100 --> 01:27:04,600
You don't have to do this.

848
01:27:06,100 --> 01:27:07,300
Alright, maybe you do.

849
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:23,400
Shoot on sight.

850
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:33,300
I can help. Point me at 'em.

851
01:27:33,700 --> 01:27:34,700
Go.

852
01:27:43,100 --> 01:27:44,300
Go. Now.

853
01:27:51,100 --> 01:27:52,600
Did I get them?

854
01:27:52,635 --> 01:27:53,800
Yeah.

855
01:28:03,700 --> 01:28:04,800
- Let's go.
- I can't go.

856
01:28:04,835 --> 01:28:06,065
Kayla, come on.

857
01:28:06,100 --> 01:28:07,500
I have to stay here.

858
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:10,100
You take them.

859
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:11,500
Go.

860
01:28:12,500 --> 01:28:13,500
Go.

861
01:28:41,200 --> 01:28:42,200
Go left.

862
01:28:42,500 --> 01:28:43,500
Left.

863
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:46,365
- What?
- We go left.

864
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:48,500
- You can't see.
- Trust me.

865
01:29:02,500 --> 01:29:04,600
C'mon Bob. Let's see
your dance up here.

866
01:29:41,700 --> 01:29:43,300
Nobody kills you but me.

867
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:53,600
Back-to-back.

868
01:29:56,400 --> 01:29:57,900
- I got him.
- Oh no, you don't.

869
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:34,600
Stop.

870
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:36,680
- This can't be the way.
- This is the way.

871
01:31:36,700 --> 01:31:38,365
- How do you know?
- I just know.

872
01:31:38,600 --> 01:31:39,600
Come on.

873
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:51,800
Adamantium bullets.

874
01:31:53,200 --> 01:31:56,500
Let's see him heal with a few of
these through his thick skull.

875
01:31:56,535 --> 01:31:59,100
You can't stop him.
Even with that.

876
01:31:59,135 --> 01:32:00,365
He'll heal.

877
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:02,700
His brain may heal.

878
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,800
But his memories won't grow back.

879
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:26,100
This doesn't change anything
between us, Victor.

880
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:28,865
We're done.

881
01:32:28,900 --> 01:32:31,500
We can never be done, Jimmy.

882
01:32:31,535 --> 01:32:33,465
We're brothers.

883
01:32:33,500 --> 01:32:36,100
Brothers look out for each other.

884
01:33:09,500 --> 01:33:11,300
- You miss me?
- Jesus...

885
01:33:13,500 --> 01:33:15,660
You know, when you said you
were gonna kill everyone...

886
01:33:15,680 --> 01:33:17,800
I thought you may just've
been exaggerating.

887
01:33:18,300 --> 01:33:19,300
Yeah...

888
01:33:20,500 --> 01:33:22,300
Do I look like a man
who exaggerates?

889
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:23,800
You're welcome.

890
01:33:27,900 --> 01:33:28,900
Logan.

891
01:33:32,500 --> 01:33:34,060
These kids trying to
get off the island.

892
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:35,545
- Split up. Go.
- I'm on it.

893
01:33:44,700 --> 01:33:45,700
Kayla.

894
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:47,800
Kayla.

895
01:33:56,800 --> 01:33:58,900
I love you.

896
01:34:06,400 --> 01:34:07,400
No...

897
01:34:10,900 --> 01:34:12,365
I'm so cold.

898
01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:15,400
Listen to me, I'm gonna
get you outta here.

899
01:34:15,435 --> 01:34:16,435
You understand?

900
01:34:17,400 --> 01:34:18,560
Let's go easy, nice and easy.

901
01:34:18,900 --> 01:34:20,600
That's it.

902
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:25,800
I'm gonna get you out.

903
01:34:49,400 --> 01:34:50,500
Logan.

904
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:47,700
I should make you
pull the trigger.

905
01:35:49,400 --> 01:35:51,600
But that would make us
no better than you.

906
01:35:53,400 --> 01:35:55,200
Throw the gun away.

907
01:36:00,500 --> 01:36:02,060
Turn around. Walk until
your feet bleed.

908
01:36:03,700 --> 01:36:05,300
And then keep walking.

909
01:36:43,300 --> 01:36:45,600
It'll be all right, Scott.

910
01:36:45,635 --> 01:36:47,917
My name is Charles Xavier.

911
01:36:47,952 --> 01:36:50,165
I'm a mutant, like you.

912
01:36:50,200 --> 01:36:54,800
- I can hear your thoughts.
- Yes. And I can hear yours.

913
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,165
You're safe now.

914
01:36:57,200 --> 01:36:59,500
Come. We have to go.

915
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:49,800
The kids are safe.

916
01:37:55,500 --> 01:37:56,700
What the hell happened?

917
01:38:00,300 --> 01:38:03,300
- Who are you?
- What do you mean, who am I?

918
01:38:03,700 --> 01:38:05,900
I'm the guy who brought you
here. Now we gotta go.

919
01:38:07,300 --> 01:38:09,400
Where the hell am I?

920
01:38:09,600 --> 01:38:12,000
Listen to me, I am a friend.

921
01:38:12,200 --> 01:38:13,600
I'm a friend.

922
01:38:13,635 --> 01:38:15,067
What's my name?

923
01:38:15,102 --> 01:38:16,500
What's my name.

924
01:38:16,700 --> 01:38:18,900
Your name is Logan.

925
01:38:22,200 --> 01:38:24,900
You need to trust
me. We have to go.

926
01:38:30,400 --> 01:38:32,100
Follow me.

927
01:38:37,400 --> 01:38:38,400
Now.

928
01:39:12,200 --> 01:39:13,900
Do you know her?

929
01:39:17,700 --> 01:39:18,700
No.

930
01:39:23,800 --> 01:39:26,240
These dudes are not gonna like
what you've done in this place.

931
01:39:26,260 --> 01:39:28,117
We really need to go.

932
01:39:28,152 --> 01:39:30,400
I'll find my own way.

933
01:39:35,100 --> 01:39:36,400
Good luck.

934
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
Colonel Stryker?

935
01:41:13,800 --> 01:41:17,300
- Colonel William Stryker?
- Yes.

936
01:41:18,700 --> 01:41:19,980
You're wanted for questioning...

937
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,800
in connection of the
death of General Munson.

938
01:41:22,835 --> 01:41:23,900
Sir.
