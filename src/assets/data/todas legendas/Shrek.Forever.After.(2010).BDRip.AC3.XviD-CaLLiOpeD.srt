1
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:45,377
Once upon a time, a long time ago,

2
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:49,048
a king and queen had a
beautiful daughter named Fiona.

3
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:51,925
But she was possessed
by a terrible curse.

4
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:56,722
By day, a lovely princess.
By night, a hideous ogre.

5
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,641
Only true love's kiss
could lift her curse.

6
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:03,979
So Fiona waited in a tower,
guarded by a dragon, until the day

7
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:06,857
when her true love would arrive.

8
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:09,359
But as the days turned into years,

9
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:13,489
the King and Queen were forced
to resort to more desperate measures.

10
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,126
Whoa, there.

11
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:10,212
I don't know about this, Lillian.

12
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:14,716
Fairy Godmother said only true love's
kiss could break Fiona's curse.

13
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:19,138
I don't trust that woman, Harold.
This may be our last hope.

14
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:22,432
Besides, he does come
highly recommended by King Midas.

15
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:27,229
But to put our daughter's life
in the hands of this... person?

16
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:32,109
He's devious.
He's deceitful. He's, he's...

17
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:34,653
Rumpelstiltskin!

18
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:40,033
Mrs Highness.

19
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,077
How do you do?

20
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,747
Down, Fifi. Get down!

21
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:50,252
As you can see, everything's in order.

22
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:54,131
So you'll put an end
to our daughter's curse?

23
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:58,635
And, in return, you sign the kingdom
of Far Far Away over to me.

24
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:08,854
- Lillian, this is madness!
- What choice do we have?

25
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:12,566
Fiona has been locked away
in that tower far too long.

26
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:14,818
It's not like she's getting any younger.

27
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:17,654
But to sign over our entire kingdom?

28
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:20,741
Well, if your kingdom's worth
more to you than your daughter...

29
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:24,536
Nothing is worth more to us
than our daughter.

30
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,541
Jump, Fifi, jump!

31
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:39,551
Just sign it and all your problems
will disappear.

32
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:52,564
Your Highness! The Princess!
She's been saved!

33
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,071
Who saved her?

34
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:02,616
No one would have guessed
that an ogre named Shrek,

35
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:04,868
whose roar was feared
throughout the land,

36
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:07,704
would save the beautiful Princess Fiona.

37
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:10,832
True love's kiss led to marriage
and ogre babies!

38
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,127
The kingdom of Far Far Away
was finally at peace.

39
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:18,674
Goody for them!
And they lived happily ever after!

40
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,053
Sir? You're gonna
have to pay for that.

41
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,974
Maybe we could make a deal
for it, little boy?

42
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:30,852
- Oh, I'm not a real boy.
- Do you want to be?

43
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:37,776
Nobody needs your deals
anymore, Grumpel Stinkypants!

44
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:47,286
I wish that ogre was never born!

45
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,550
Wake up, Daddy, wake up!

46
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:05,470
- Good morning.
- Good morning to you.

47
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:10,142
Better out than in.

48
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:12,060
That's my line.

49
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:15,188
Did my little Fergus make a...

50
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:18,608
...big, grownup ogre stink?!

51
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:21,987
Oh, that's diabolical!

52
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:27,326
And on your left, the lovable lug
that showed us you don't have to

53
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:29,870
change your undies
to change the world!

54
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,206
I wonder what Shrek's up to in there.

55
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:36,668
Get in there. Get...
Impossible to put on!

56
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:40,964
OK, the dragon goes under the bridge,
through the loop...

57
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:43,508
...and finally, into the castle.

58
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,223
Play date!

59
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,399
Then Shrek kissed the Princess.

60
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:01,610
She turned into a beautiful ogre
and they lived...

61
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:02,819
Happily...

62
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:04,446
- Ever...
- After.

63
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,412
Look! A shooting star!

64
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,625
So, what did you wish for?

65
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,877
That every day could be like this one.

66
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,504
Come here, you.

67
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:34,851
Morning, Daddy.

68
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:36,144
Morning.

69
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,398
Better out than in.

70
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,567
Did my little Fergus make a...

71
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,948
Cute. Real cute.

72
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:50,909
This lovable lug taught us

73
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:53,995
you don't have to change
your undies to change the world!

74
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,081
Play date!

75
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:01,294
Shrek! The outhouse is clogged up!

76
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:04,423
She turned into a beautiful ogre
and they lived...

77
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:05,590
- Happily...
- Ever...

78
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:06,800
After?

79
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,763
- Daddy, get up!
- Morning.

80
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:16,768
- Better out than in.
- This lovable lug...

81
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:19,104
- Play date!
- No!

82
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,190
Outhouse again!

83
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:23,442
Come on.

84
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:28,530
Undies!

85
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:31,450
Outhouse!

86
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,743
- Get up, get up!
- And they lived...

87
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:35,370
- Happily...
- Ever...

88
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:36,788
After.

89
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:28,840
Roar.

90
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,558
Nice landing, baby.

91
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:22,102
Hey! Now remember, don't eat the valet.

92
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:27,190
Happy birthday, nińos!
Vamos a la fiesta!

93
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:30,151
Hey, Shrek, Shrek!

94
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,947
Mr Shrek, would you
sign our pitchforks?

95
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:35,198
And our torches?

96
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:37,075
Oh, man, you used to be so fierce!

97
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,077
Yeah, when you were a real ogre!

98
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,162
A real ogre?

99
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:55,635
Shrek, it's a sing-along.
You've got to sing along!

100
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:58,930
- No, thanks.
- Please? I'll be your best friend.

101
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:03,560
Why does being your best friend entail
me doing everything I don't want to do?

102
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:06,062
Please, Felicia, not in Daddy's ear.

103
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,480
Excuse me, Mr Shrek?

104
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:09,816
Could you do that
ogre roar of yours for my son?

105
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:11,484
He's a big, big fan.

106
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:12,777
Do the roar.

107
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:15,739
You know, I'd rather not.
It's my kids' birthday party.

108
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:17,907
- Do the roar.
- Honey?

109
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:19,409
Why don't you go check on the cake?

110
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:22,954
- Sure.
- And don't forget the candles.

111
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,122
Hold still.

112
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,291
Thanks for the pants, Muffin Man.

113
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:29,336
I always wanted chaps!
Yee-haw! Giddy up!

114
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,879
- Monsieur Shrek.
- Howdy, Shrek!

115
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:32,881
Your cake. Voilà!

116
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:37,218
- What is that supposed to be?
- That's Sprinkles the Ogre!

117
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:39,763
Isn't he cute? He looks just like you.

118
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,182
But happy. It's a party, Shrek.
You gotta cheer up!

119
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,933
I'm in a great mood, actually.

120
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:46,978
- Oh, I'm gonna lick me a rainbow!
- Donkey!

121
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:48,313
As long as you're not doing anything,

122
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:49,939
how about one of those
famous Shrek roars?

123
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:52,651
- Do the roar.
- Let me set you straight, Butter Pants.

124
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:55,362
An ogre only roars when he's angry.

125
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:57,614
You don't want to see me angry, do you?

126
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:59,074
Do it.

127
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,369
Hold it together. Just hold it together.

128
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:04,621
Daddy, he's getting away. Do something.

129
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:06,081
Oh, good.

130
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:09,751
- What happened to the cake?
- Trust me. It's an improvement.

131
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,503
- You licked it!
- No.

132
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,547
Just because you're an ogre,
doesn't mean you have to eat like one.

133
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:17,008
Looks like you forgot the candles!

134
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,427
OK, just watch the cake.
I'll go get them.

135
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:20,887
Watch the cake?

136
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,682
- Where's the cake?!
- We ate the cake.

137
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:24,933
- Ya.
- What?

138
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:26,351
No, don't cry.

139
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,020
Hey! I believe you
promised my son a roar.

140
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,605
- Do the roar.
- Roar.

141
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:33,066
- I don't like it.
- Pigs, we need another cake.

142
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:36,069
- We ate the other cakes.
- One roar, man.

143
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:38,655
Hey, everybody!
Shrek's gonna do his famous ogre roar!

144
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:41,533
Not now, Donkey.
Pigs, are there any cupcakes?

145
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,576
- We ate them, too.
- They have lollipops.

146
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:44,911
No, I ate them.

147
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:47,789
- You didn't share?
- Well, you didn't share the croissants!

148
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:50,959
- Everything's gonna be OK.
- Shrek, what's going on?

149
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:53,086
- Come on, Shrek, your fans are waiting!
- Do the roar.

150
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,548
We need the cake!

151
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:00,218
Cake! Cake! Cake!

152
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:16,359
I love you, Daddy.

153
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:19,237
Everybody, I have found another cake!

154
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,615
Shrek? Are you OK?

155
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:53,563
- Unbelievable.
- Tell me about it! Those villagers...

156
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:57,066
I'm not talking about the villagers,
Shrek. I'm talking about you.

157
00:12:57,234 --> 00:13:00,236
Is this really how you want
to remember the kids' first birthday?

158
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:04,407
- Oh, great. So this is all my fault?
- Yes. But you know what?

159
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:06,618
Let's talk about this
after the party, at home.

160
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:09,496
You mean that roadside
attraction we live in?

161
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:14,167
Step right up! See the dancing ogre!
Don't worry! He won't bite!

162
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:18,505
I used to be an ogre.
Now I'm just a jolly green joke!

163
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:22,967
OK, OK, maybe you're not
the ogre you used to be.

164
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:24,844
But maybe that's not such a bad thing.

165
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:28,681
I wouldn't expect you to understand.
It's not like you're a real ogre.

166
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:31,142
You spent half your life in a palace.

167
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,853
And the other half
locked away in a tower.

168
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:39,317
Look, all I want is for things to go
back to the way they used to be!

169
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:44,239
Back when villagers were afraid of me,
and I could take a mud bath in peace.

170
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:47,992
When I could do what I wanted,
when I wanted to do it!

171
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,538
Back when the world made sense!

172
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:54,374
You mean back before you
rescued me from the Dragon's Keep?

173
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:55,917
Exactly!

174
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:06,010
Shrek, you have
three beautiful children,

175
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:08,346
a wife who loves you,

176
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:12,559
friends who adore you.
You have everything.

177
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:19,399
Why is it the only person
who can't see that is you?

178
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:41,880
That's just great.

179
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,723
If she thinks I'm gonna
slink back there and apologize,

180
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:52,307
If she thinks I'm gonna
slink back there and apologize,

181
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:55,727
she's got another thing coming.
She's not the boss of me.

182
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:59,731
I'm an ogre and I'm not gonna apologize
for acting like one.

183
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:04,235
Help, please!
Someone, anyone at all, help me!

184
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,154
Please, help!

185
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:08,197
Please, help!

186
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,366
I'm stuck! Help!

187
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:12,368
Oh, please, help!

188
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:15,330
Someone, anyone! Help me!

189
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:19,000
The pain! I can see
a bright light. A tunnel!

190
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,628
Grandma? Is that you?

191
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:23,171
Yeah, it's me, Granny.

192
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:26,925
An ogre! Please, Mr Ogre,
please don't eat me!

193
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:28,635
I'm not gonna eat you.

194
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:32,096
But you are an ogre... Aren't you?

195
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:35,099
Yeah, well, I... I used to be.

196
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:37,685
Look, move out or get crushed.

197
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:39,854
So you're not gonna eat me?

198
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:44,859
No, thanks. I already had a big bowl
of curly-toed weirdo for breakfast.

199
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:49,238
Wait up! What's your rush?
Where you going?

200
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:50,406
Nowhere.

201
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:53,242
What a coincidence!
I was just heading that way myself.

202
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:57,914
But, seriously,
let me give you a ride. I insist.

203
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:02,460
Come on. It's the least I can do
after all you've done for me.

204
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:05,546
I got a hot rat cooking.

205
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:11,177
All right! Can I interest you
in a mudslide? Slug and tonic?

206
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:14,305
A liquid libation
to ease that frustration?

207
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:18,768
- Eyeball-tini?
- Well, maybe just one.

208
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:23,690
So the centaur says,
"That's not the half I'm talking about. "

209
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:27,443
I gotta say, Shrek, I envy you.

210
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:30,947
To live the life of an ogre...
no worries, no responsibilities.

211
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:33,866
You are free to pillage
and terrorize as you please.

212
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:37,328
- Free? That's a laugh.
- Oh, yeah?

213
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:43,084
Sometimes I wish I had just one day
to feel like a real ogre again.

214
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:44,377
Why didn't you say so?

215
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:47,714
Magical transactions are my specialty!

216
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:51,592
Great. Next to mimes,
magicians are my favourite people.

217
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:54,053
Hold on.

218
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:57,390
"King for a Month. "
"Knight for a Week. "

219
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:02,770
Ogre for a day.

220
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:06,441
Think about it, Shrek.
To be feared and hated.

221
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:07,650
You'll be, like, "Roar!"

222
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:11,404
And the villagers will be, like, "Get
away! It's Shrek! I'm so scared of him!"

223
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:14,949
It would be just like the good old days,
when your swamp was your castle.

224
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:20,747
- When the world made sense.
- All right, what's the catch?

225
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:24,584
Catch? No. There's no catch.
No catchings, really.

226
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:26,836
I mean, there's something.
Small thing. Nothing. A little thing.

227
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:30,006
All right, I knew it.
So what do you want?

228
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:32,008
- A day.
- A day.

229
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:33,217
Rat's done!

230
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:37,930
To make the magic work, you gotta
give something to get something.

231
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:41,017
In this case, you gotta
give a day to get a day. That's all.

232
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:43,895
I can't just pick up
and leave my family.

233
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:47,732
But that's the best part, Shrek!
It's a magical contract.

234
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,734
No one will even know you're gone.

235
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:55,698
And by the time this day is up,
you are gonna feel like a changed ogre.

236
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:58,659
Still, I don't know.

237
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:02,371
Hey, no problem.
Forget it, no big D. Doesn't matter.

238
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:05,041
Do you like white meat or dark meat?

239
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:09,295
So what day would I have to give up?

240
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:12,340
I don't know, any day.
A day from your past.

241
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:14,926
A day you had the flu?
A day you lost a pet?

242
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,512
A day some meddling oaf
stuck his nose where it didn't belong

243
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,305
destroying your business
and ruining your life?!

244
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:24,435
Just for an example.

245
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,354
How about the day I met Donkey?

246
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:29,023
Now, there's a day
I'd like to take back.

247
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,192
I don't know who that is.

248
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:34,612
I know. What about a day
you wouldn't even remember?

249
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,989
Like a day when you were a baby.

250
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:42,411
- An innocent, mindless little baby.
- Take any of those days you want.

251
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:46,958
- Take them all for all I care.
- Oh, just one will do.

252
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:51,003
OK, good.
A day from your childhood it is.

253
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:54,799
I guess there's nothing wrong
with wanting a little time for myself.

254
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:56,509
Just 24 tiny little hours.

255
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,761
- I'm still my own ogre!
- Yeah, you is!

256
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:01,180
I never needed to ask
for anyone's permission before.

257
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:04,016
So why start now?

258
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:14,152
Go on, Shrek.

259
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:15,862
Sign it!

260
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:18,406
Go on, Shrek.

261
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:21,075
Sign it, Shrek! Sign it!

262
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:24,078
You signed it.

263
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:27,039
So, tell me. What happens now?

264
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:28,875
Have a nice day.

265
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:49,270
I think I fell on my keys.

266
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:51,022
There are 40 children in that shoe,

267
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,733
which is why the weasel
goes pop to this very day.

268
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:54,942
Oh, great.

269
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:57,612
As we head over the river
and through the woods...

270
00:19:57,779 --> 00:19:58,821
Ogre!

271
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:24,096
Kill the ogre! Kill the ogre!

272
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:20,444
This is the part where you run away!

273
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:44,510
Sure is great to be wanted again.

274
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:47,346
Nice one.

275
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:57,398
Fiona?

276
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:09,076
Oh, no.

277
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,717
My home.

278
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:27,386
Fiona!

279
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:32,391
Fiona! Are you in there?!

280
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:12,264
All right, Rumpel!

281
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:15,434
This wasn't part of the deal!

282
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:20,272
Rumpel!

283
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,712
Ogre!

284
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:48,134
We've got another one, ladies! Get him!

285
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:51,345
Who are you?!

286
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:53,514
What are you doing in my swamp?

287
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:01,981
Looks like a troublemaker!

288
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:15,828
Spread 'em!

289
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:20,166
Nice job, ladies!

290
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:32,011
You witches are making a big mistake!
I know my rights!

291
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:34,513
You have the right to shut your mouth!

292
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:57,870
Donkey, stop with the singing, will you?

293
00:24:58,705 --> 00:25:00,039
Donkey!

294
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:11,884
Donkey, where am I? What's happening?

295
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:15,221
Quiet down there! Oh, I hate this song.

296
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:24,730
I'm driving,
so I'm in charge of the music.

297
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:28,734
Will you witches make up your mind?

298
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:41,121
Donkey? What's going on?
Do you know where Fiona is?

299
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:44,458
Quiet, ogre! You're gonna get me
in trouble and I need this job.

300
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:46,293
I am not going back to work
for Old MacDonald.

301
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:49,255
Tell me to E-I-E-I-O.
"E-I-E-I-No!" That's what I said.

302
00:25:49,422 --> 00:25:53,133
Where are my babies?
And where's your wife, Dragon?

303
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:56,136
Look, I think you have me confused
with some other talking donkey.

304
00:25:56,304 --> 00:25:57,680
I've never seen you before in my life.

305
00:25:57,847 --> 00:26:00,432
Never seen me before?
Come on, Donkey!

306
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,768
And how do you
know my name anyway?

307
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:05,813
It's me, Shrek. Your best friend?

308
00:26:06,481 --> 00:26:07,898
A donkey and an ogre friends?

309
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:10,317
That's the most
ridiculous thing I ever heard!

310
00:26:13,154 --> 00:26:15,656
Can you at least tell me
where they're taking me?

311
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:18,993
To the same place they take
every ogre. To Rumpelstiltskin.

312
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:22,871
- Stiltskin!
- I said quiet!

313
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:33,007
Oh, no.

314
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:46,979
It's time to crumble!

315
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:51,483
Place your bets!
Place your bets! We start tout de suite!

316
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:52,693
Yeah!

317
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:57,197
Gingy?

318
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:02,995
Gingy snap!

319
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:06,624
There's one!

320
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:08,500
Disgusting, filthy ogre!

321
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:10,419
Hideous monster!

322
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:12,212
Filthy, filthy creature!

323
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:14,673
Disgusting creature!

324
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:42,451
Move it!

325
00:27:59,552 --> 00:28:02,304
Don't worry, Donkey.
I'll get us our lives back.

326
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:05,641
Yeah, right. Put a little mustard
on mine, Captain Crazy!

327
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:44,596
Mr Stiltskin?

328
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:48,767
You got another customer.

329
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:51,645
- Wolfie!
- Yes, Mr Stiltskin.

330
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:53,647
Bring me my business wig.

331
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:56,024
Mr Stiltskin, please!

332
00:28:58,945 --> 00:29:01,405
- OK, go.
- Please make me a real boy!

333
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:04,950
Go away! Terms are
in the details, balsa boy.

334
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:07,870
Sayonara, termites! Hello, acne!

335
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:09,788
Stiltskin!

336
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:12,249
Shrek!

337
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:15,669
There he is!

338
00:29:16,671 --> 00:29:18,088
So close!

339
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,800
Have I been waiting for you!

340
00:29:22,677 --> 00:29:25,179
Ladies, this is the guy

341
00:29:25,346 --> 00:29:28,724
that made all of this possible!

342
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:32,352
So, tell me, how are you
enjoying your day?

343
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,647
All right, Rumpel, what's going on?
What have you done?

344
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:38,984
No, Shrek, it's not what I've done.
It's what you've done.

345
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:42,946
Thanks to you, the King and Queen
signed their kingdom over to me.

346
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:44,531
They would never do that.

347
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:49,328
They would if I promised them
all their problems would disappear.

348
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:53,165
And then they disappeared!

349
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:03,884
They would have done anything

350
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:06,178
if they thought it would
end their daughter's curse.

351
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:08,722
I ended Fiona's curse!

352
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:12,226
How could you when you never existed?

353
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:15,395
You better start making sense,
you dirty little man!

354
00:30:15,563 --> 00:30:17,856
Here, let me spell it out for you!

355
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:22,361
You gave me a day from your past,
a day you couldn't even remember.

356
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:26,740
A day when you were
an innocent, mindless little baby.

357
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:31,954
You took the day I was born.

358
00:30:32,121 --> 00:30:35,123
No, Shrek. You gave it to me.

359
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:38,836
Enjoy this while you can, Stiltskin,
because when this day is up...

360
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:41,713
But you haven't heard the best part.

361
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:47,594
Since you were never born, once
this day comes to an end, so will you.

362
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:53,267
Where's Fiona?

363
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:55,185
Where's my family?

364
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:58,564
Silly little ogre.
You don't get it, do you?

365
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:01,275
You see, you were never born.

366
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:03,569
You never met Fiona.

367
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:07,322
Your kids don't exist.

368
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:13,412
How's that for a metaphysical paradox?

369
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:17,666
Looks like you got
exactly what you wanted!

370
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:21,920
- Happy Ogre Day!
- Rumpel!

371
00:31:23,923 --> 00:31:25,215
Get him, witches!

372
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:38,979
You know what'd help morale
around here? Flip-flop Fridays.

373
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:41,815
Feet be comfortable
with the breeze on your toes.

374
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:50,490
Come on, girls!

375
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:04,838
Lock all the doors,
you worthless witches! Do it!

376
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:09,259
I'll be right back, Donkey!

377
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:12,846
I don't know you! I don't know him!

378
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:34,326
I'm glad I'm not you.

379
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:40,332
Help me! Help!

380
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:42,542
Help!

381
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:52,552
No, not my pretty ball!

382
00:32:57,016 --> 00:32:58,850
Watch out!

383
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:12,030
Wolfie?

384
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:14,533
My angry wig.

385
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:26,545
Help! I've been kidnapped
by a deranged, unbalanced ogre!

386
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:28,130
Donkey! Get off of me!

387
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:31,216
Watch it with your pointy hooves!

388
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:39,891
- Just take my wallet!
- Hey!

389
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:42,060
I'm being ass-napped!

390
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:43,854
Animal cruelty! Help!

391
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:46,106
You need to calm down!

392
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:47,441
I'm your friend.

393
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:50,277
I'm not gonna hurt you, all right?

394
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:53,113
Good. I'm gonna let go...

395
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:55,741
...right... now.

396
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:58,452
Please! Eat my face last!
Send my hooves to my mama!

397
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:01,079
Donkey! You've got to trust me.

398
00:34:01,247 --> 00:34:03,832
- Why should I trust you?
- Because...

399
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,084
Because...

400
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:11,089
OK.

401
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:53,173
Fine! Go ahead!
Run away! Who needs you?

402
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:29,376
I've never seen an ogre cry.

403
00:35:34,882 --> 00:35:36,591
I'm not crying.

404
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:38,802
It's nothing to be ashamed of.
I cry all the time.

405
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:41,888
Just thinking about my grandma,
or thinking about baby kittens,

406
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:46,393
or my grandma kissing a baby kitten,
or a little baby grandma kitten.

407
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:50,689
- That is so darn sad.
- I said, I'm not crying!

408
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:52,732
Take it easy, I'm only trying to help.

409
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,734
It's none of my business
why you're upset.

410
00:35:55,736 --> 00:35:57,070
By the way, why are you upset?

411
00:35:57,238 --> 00:36:00,115
I was tricked into signing something
I shouldn't have.

412
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:02,576
You signed up for one of them
time-shares, huh?

413
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:05,412
No. I signed this.

414
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,582
You should never sign a contract
with Rumpelstiltskin!

415
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:10,083
Yeah, I got that.

416
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:12,252
- His fine print is crafty.
- I know.

417
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,754
- His exit clauses are sneaky.
- Yeah, I...

418
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:18,049
- What did you say?
- I'm talking about the exit clause.

419
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:19,384
Used to be, you had to guess his name,

420
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:21,469
but now everybody knows
who Rumpelstiltskin is.

421
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:23,263
Donkey, I've read the fine print.

422
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:25,765
There's nothing
about an exit clause in here.

423
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:27,851
Well, you didn't expect him
to make it easy for you.

424
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:30,270
Here, let me show you how it's done.

425
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:31,938
I didn't spend all that time
around them witches

426
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:33,773
without picking up a few tricks.

427
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:36,151
Your tiny, little ogre brain
couldn't begin to comprehend

428
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:38,612
the complexity
of my polygonic foldability skills.

429
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:40,030
What are you doing?

430
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:43,283
Hey, I can't get my origami on
unless you back off.

431
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:46,745
Thank you. OK, here's what you
gotta do. You fold this piece here,

432
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:49,289
make this letter match up here,
bring this corner here,

433
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:53,627
and if you do it just right,
it will show you what to do. There!

434
00:36:53,794 --> 00:36:56,129
"Try Lou's Bliss. "

435
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:00,175
Who's Lou?

436
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:02,135
Give me that!

437
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:09,517
"True Love's Kiss. "

438
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:14,314
You have to take me to dinner first.

439
00:37:15,149 --> 00:37:18,318
"According to fairy tale law,
if not fully satisfied,

440
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:21,988
true love's kiss will render
this contract null and void. "

441
00:37:22,156 --> 00:37:25,659
Donkey, you did it! Look at you!

442
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:30,622
If Fiona and I share true love's kiss,
I will get my life back!

443
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:33,708
OK! This isn't a petting zoo!
So where is this Fiona?

444
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:36,795
Well, that's just it, you see.

445
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:38,838
I don't know.

446
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:41,174
You know, when I lose something,
I always try to retrace my steps.

447
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:43,677
So... where did you leave her last?

448
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:46,513
The last time I saw her,

449
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:49,349
I told her I wished
I'd never rescued her.

450
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:54,479
- Oh, no.
- Shrek?

451
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:57,232
Shrek! Shrek, wait! Wait, Shrek!

452
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,526
What, are you crazy?
That's the Dragon's Keep!

453
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:01,611
They keep dragons in there!

454
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:04,906
OK, yeah, fine! Go ahead!

455
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:07,993
I'm gonna just hang back here
and find us some breakfast!

456
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:20,046
Fiona!

457
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:56,916
Oh, no.

458
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:10,138
If I didn't save Fiona...

459
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,809
...then who did?

460
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:30,158
This is the favour Fiona was
supposed to give me on the day we met.

461
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:33,828
It's a symbol of our love.

462
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:35,789
Now smell it!

463
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:37,832
Hey, man, get that dirty
favour out of my face!

464
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,544
Your nose is the only chance
I have of tracking down my wife,

465
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:44,297
so stop complaining and start smelling.

466
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:45,924
Smell it! Get it! Away you go, girl!

467
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:47,801
Do I look like a bloodhound to you?

468
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:50,387
In case you haven't noticed,
I'm a donkey, not a dog!

469
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:53,306
If I was a dog, they'd call me Dog,
not Donkey!

470
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:54,849
And another thing...

471
00:39:55,851 --> 00:39:57,310
Wait a minute.

472
00:39:57,978 --> 00:39:59,396
I think I got something.

473
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:02,315
- Whatever it is, it's sweet.
- Fiona.

474
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:04,109
Luscious and tasty.

475
00:40:04,276 --> 00:40:06,820
Hey! That's my wife
you're talking about.

476
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:09,489
Donkey!

477
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:15,578
Yeah! Waffles!

478
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:18,706
And I thought the Waffle Fairy
was just a bedtime story.

479
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:22,836
Sticky stacks of golden,
syrupy deliciousness!

480
00:40:23,003 --> 00:40:25,171
Donkey! Don't eat that!

481
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:29,467
There's a stack of freshly made waffles
in the middle of the forest.

482
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:31,511
Don't you find that
a wee bit suspicious?

483
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:34,431
Oh, you... I'm just... What are you...?

484
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:36,558
Bad Donkey! Mustn't.

485
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:40,770
I said, don't! Don't!
No! Get away from it.

486
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:42,730
You did.

487
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:50,989
Look out!

488
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:55,118
Donkey!

489
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:57,704
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine.

490
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:00,957
Donkey.

491
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:05,044
Help! Help me!

492
00:41:05,212 --> 00:41:07,964
Help, Shrek! Help!

493
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:32,947
Watch your head.

494
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:34,491
Hey, it's a new guy!

495
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:36,784
Look at him, all dressed up
in his Sunday vest.

496
00:41:36,952 --> 00:41:38,703
He's really tiny, isn't he?

497
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:40,955
Yeah. Fate has delivered us
a comrade-in-arms

498
00:41:41,123 --> 00:41:42,749
and for that, we are thankful.
Suit him up!

499
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:44,876
- Let's go, greenie.
- Now, wait a minute!

500
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,674
- Hey!
- Here you go.

501
00:41:56,972 --> 00:41:59,766
- Welcome to the resistance.
- Resistance?

502
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:03,520
We fight for freedom
and ogres everywhere!

503
00:42:12,988 --> 00:42:14,614
I didn't know we could do that.

504
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:17,283
Help! You can't eat me! I got the mange!

505
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:21,913
- I'm poisonous! I'm all poi...
- I'll take him! This order's to go.

506
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:24,499
Hey! I haven't removed his giblets yet.

507
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:26,834
Trust me, you don't want
to eat this one.

508
00:42:27,002 --> 00:42:29,045
I go down smooth,
but come out fighting!

509
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:31,297
- Let go!
- Don't make Mama mad.

510
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:32,549
Your dinner is my friend!

511
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:34,842
- Come on, guys!
- I got to get the giblets out!

512
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:37,011
- She's back.
- There she is.

513
00:42:54,863 --> 00:42:55,947
Fiona!

514
00:42:58,075 --> 00:43:00,159
I'm so happy I found you!

515
00:43:08,335 --> 00:43:09,711
Maybe you missed orientation,

516
00:43:09,878 --> 00:43:13,381
but for future reference,
personal space is very important to me.

517
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:16,509
You don't know who I am, do you?

518
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:18,177
No.

519
00:43:18,345 --> 00:43:20,346
Brogan, I have news from Far Far Away.

520
00:43:20,514 --> 00:43:22,682
Gather the others
and meet me in the war room.

521
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:25,351
Gretched, make sure everyone
is prepared to move out tonight.

522
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:27,478
- I need to talk to you.
- What is it?

523
00:43:27,646 --> 00:43:32,191
OK, I know you don't
remember me, but...

524
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:34,444
...we're married. Hear me out.

525
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:37,363
And at the birthday party
with some pigs and a puppet,

526
00:43:37,531 --> 00:43:38,948
the villagers wanted me
to sign their pitchforks,

527
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:41,159
and this boy kept saying,
"Do the roar. "

528
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:43,745
Then I punched the cakes that the
pigs ate and the next thing I knew,

529
00:43:43,912 --> 00:43:46,247
my donkey fell in your waffle hole.

530
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:51,294
Right? Who's with me?

531
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:55,673
I guess I must have kicked him
harder than I thought.

532
00:43:55,841 --> 00:43:58,051
Fiona, I need to...

533
00:43:59,553 --> 00:44:02,055
Witches! All right, everyone,
you know the drill!

534
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:04,057
- Fiona!
- Witches! Oh, no!

535
00:44:04,224 --> 00:44:06,309
- Witches! Witches!
- Come on, now.

536
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:38,007
Fiona, that's the third patrol today.
We can't hide forever.

537
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:41,761
Trust me, Brogan.
After tonight, we won't have to.

538
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:46,516
- That's your wife?
- That's my wife.

539
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:49,977
Well, I see who wears the chain mail
in your family!

540
00:44:53,148 --> 00:44:58,152
Some people like to look
at the goblet as... as half empty.

541
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:02,323
Me, I like to look at it as half full.

542
00:45:03,158 --> 00:45:06,285
We've gone from the bottom
to the top, ladies.

543
00:45:06,453 --> 00:45:09,580
But we're not just an empire.

544
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:11,374
We're a family.

545
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:16,129
Everyone has got their cupcake?
Cupcake, cupcake? Good. Yes? Baba?

546
00:45:16,296 --> 00:45:17,296
Good.

547
00:45:17,464 --> 00:45:20,675
Yeah, you know, we have
put away a lot of ogres.

548
00:45:20,843 --> 00:45:25,012
And so one got away.
Who cares? It's not a big deal.

549
00:45:25,514 --> 00:45:27,598
It doesn't matter to me.

550
00:45:27,766 --> 00:45:30,518
It's not like it's the end of the world.

551
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:34,605
Except... funny thing.

552
00:45:34,773 --> 00:45:38,276
Now that I think about it,
the ogre who got away is Shrek!

553
00:45:38,444 --> 00:45:41,279
And if he shares a kiss
with Fiona by sunrise,

554
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:44,615
it is the end of the world! Our world!

555
00:45:44,783 --> 00:45:46,659
My empire!

556
00:45:50,205 --> 00:45:52,665
But, as I was saying,

557
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:56,878
I like to look at the goblet
as half full.

558
00:45:58,338 --> 00:46:00,339
Yelling makes me so parched.

559
00:46:00,507 --> 00:46:04,343
Would anyone care for some water?
Wet your whistle?

560
00:46:04,511 --> 00:46:07,388
A clear, crisp, delicious glass...

561
00:46:07,556 --> 00:46:10,725
...of agua purificada?

562
00:46:10,893 --> 00:46:13,227
Anybody's thirsty?
Nobody's thirsty? No?

563
00:46:14,229 --> 00:46:16,230
Well, then does anyone care to tell me

564
00:46:16,398 --> 00:46:19,025
what it's going to take
to get this ogre? You.

565
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:20,318
Faster brooms?

566
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:22,069
- No!
- Pointier hats?

567
00:46:22,237 --> 00:46:23,863
- No! You!
- Maybe we could hire

568
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:25,740
a professional bounty hunter?

569
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:29,744
What a world! What a world!

570
00:46:31,371 --> 00:46:34,290
You know, actually
not a bad idea. Baba!

571
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:36,542
I need a bounty hunter.

572
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:39,879
And if music doth
soothe the savage beast...

573
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:43,257
...then I think I might know
just the person!

574
00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:49,847
Listen up, everyone.
Word has come from Far Far Away.

575
00:46:50,015 --> 00:46:53,184
Stiltskin is leading
tonight's ogre hunt himself.

576
00:46:53,352 --> 00:46:55,061
- He's never done that before.
- What? Why?

577
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:57,063
I bet that's because of us.

578
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:58,981
If that cupcake-eating clown

579
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:02,276
finally leaves the safety
of his filthy witch nest...

580
00:47:02,945 --> 00:47:04,237
...he'll be vulnerable.

581
00:47:04,404 --> 00:47:07,573
The plan's simple.
If they follow the usual patrol route,

582
00:47:07,741 --> 00:47:09,867
they'll reach the river by midnight.

583
00:47:10,035 --> 00:47:13,538
We'll be concealed along this road,
waiting for his caravan.

584
00:47:13,705 --> 00:47:17,041
Once they reach the clearing,
I'll give the signal.

585
00:47:17,209 --> 00:47:19,085
And then we attack!

586
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:28,094
And when the smoke clears...
Wait, what's this?

587
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:29,554
That's my chimichanga stand.

588
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:32,807
No, Cookie. We won't be needing that.

589
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:36,686
Trust me, Fiona. Y'all gonna be
really hungry after this ambush, OK?

590
00:47:37,604 --> 00:47:39,397
Go and finish your little speech.

591
00:47:40,148 --> 00:47:43,609
All right, as I was saying,
when the smoke clears,

592
00:47:43,777 --> 00:47:47,488
Rumpelstiltskin is gone
and the chimichangas have been eaten.

593
00:47:47,656 --> 00:47:50,283
Far Far Away will finally be free.

594
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:52,201
- And so will we.
- Spread the word.

595
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:55,621
We move out as soon as
Rumpel leaves the palace.

596
00:47:57,958 --> 00:48:00,167
- Man, this is serious!
- Tell me about it.

597
00:48:00,335 --> 00:48:02,920
How am I ever gonna
get her to kiss me before sunrise?

598
00:48:03,088 --> 00:48:04,630
Actually, I was talking
about the revolution.

599
00:48:04,798 --> 00:48:06,299
Revolution?

600
00:48:06,466 --> 00:48:08,384
Why don't you just
tell her what you told me?

601
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:11,178
About how you're her true love and
you came from an alternate universe.

602
00:48:11,346 --> 00:48:13,139
Well, while I'm at it,
why don't I tell her

603
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:15,308
that you're married
to a fire-breathing dragon

604
00:48:15,475 --> 00:48:18,519
and you have little, mutant
donkey-dragon babies.

605
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:20,187
I do?!

606
00:48:20,355 --> 00:48:23,274
You saw what happened.
She's gonna think I'm crazy.

607
00:48:23,442 --> 00:48:24,650
I'm a daddy?

608
00:48:24,818 --> 00:48:28,195
You know what?
If I got Fiona to kiss me once...

609
00:48:30,198 --> 00:48:31,991
...then I can do it again.

610
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:35,077
Shrek, do my babies
have hooves or talons?

611
00:48:35,245 --> 00:48:36,829
Donkey...!

612
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:38,414
Hello?

613
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:41,042
Fiona?

614
00:48:47,049 --> 00:48:50,134
You should not be here, seńor.

615
00:48:50,302 --> 00:48:51,677
Puss?

616
00:48:57,184 --> 00:48:58,893
You've gotta be kidding me.

617
00:49:12,741 --> 00:49:15,201
Feed me, if you dare.

618
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:18,704
Puss, what happened to you?
You got so fa...

619
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:23,084
- ... fancy.
- Do I know you?

620
00:49:23,251 --> 00:49:25,836
Well, where's your hat?
Where's your belt?

621
00:49:26,004 --> 00:49:27,755
Your wee little boots?

622
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:30,383
Boots? For a cat? Ha!

623
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:33,636
But you're Puss in Boots.

624
00:49:34,262 --> 00:49:35,846
Maybe once.

625
00:49:36,014 --> 00:49:37,556
But that is a name I have outgrown.

626
00:49:37,724 --> 00:49:39,392
That's not the only thing
you've outgrown.

627
00:49:39,559 --> 00:49:43,646
Hey! I may have let myself go
a little since retirement,

628
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:46,399
but hanging up my sword
was the best decision of my life.

629
00:49:46,566 --> 00:49:49,610
I have all the cream I can drink
and all the mice I can chase.

630
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:52,613
I'll get him later.

631
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:55,199
Puss, what have I done to you?

632
00:49:55,367 --> 00:49:56,826
You've gone soft.

633
00:49:57,619 --> 00:50:01,789
Well, I do get brushed twice a day.

634
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:04,583
Look, it's not too late to fix it.

635
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:07,003
All you have to do is help me
get a kiss from Fiona.

636
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:10,297
What are you doing?
Can I help you with something?

637
00:50:10,465 --> 00:50:13,426
Well, I know how stressful
mounting a rebellion can be...

638
00:50:13,593 --> 00:50:15,594
...rallying the troops,
planning attacks,

639
00:50:15,762 --> 00:50:19,557
so I brought you a little something
to ease the tension.

640
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:21,183
A gift basket?

641
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:23,978
You're welcome.
So let's see what you got.

642
00:50:24,146 --> 00:50:26,522
Heart-shaped box of slugs.

643
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:29,608
Skunk-scented candle.

644
00:50:29,776 --> 00:50:34,155
- Look, this really isn't the...
- What's this? Coupons!

645
00:50:34,322 --> 00:50:36,365
Let's see,
"Good for one free foot massage. "

646
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:38,868
"A mud facial!"
Oh, and here's one...

647
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:42,580
"Good for one free kiss. "
Let's cash it now.

648
00:50:42,748 --> 00:50:44,749
Look, I don't know
what this is all about,

649
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:46,459
but I'm trying to run a revolution.

650
00:50:46,626 --> 00:50:48,836
So unless you have
Rumpelstiltskin's head in there,

651
00:50:49,004 --> 00:50:51,130
I suggest you take your gift basket,

652
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:55,009
get out of my tent
and go make yourself useful!

653
00:50:55,677 --> 00:50:59,972
Wow. You're right. I am sorry.

654
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:03,184
I was just trying to be friendly.
No hard feelings?

655
00:51:04,811 --> 00:51:05,853
An apologetic hug?

656
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:08,355
And a quick kiss goodbye.

657
00:51:09,858 --> 00:51:10,858
Hey!

658
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:13,652
Wait! Is that mistletoe I see?

659
00:51:15,363 --> 00:51:18,741
Hey, Shrek! Are my babies cute, or do
they make people feel uncomfortable?

660
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:22,036
- Where'd we find that guy?
- Could it be true?

661
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:26,415
Have the years of prim
and pampery made me soft?

662
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:29,502
Don't be silly.
Now who's a pretty kitty?

663
00:51:29,669 --> 00:51:31,253
I am.

664
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:41,597
Daddy thinks you look real nice, Fifi.

665
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:43,933
Honk.

666
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:45,684
All right, Piggies, be gone!

667
00:51:45,852 --> 00:51:48,062
Don't forget to take
her little potty box with you.

668
00:51:49,022 --> 00:51:50,981
This little piggy wants to go home!

669
00:51:51,149 --> 00:51:54,443
- Mr Stiltskin! He's here.
- Nice.

670
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:11,377
Pied Piper. How was your commute?

671
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:14,547
Good.

672
00:52:14,714 --> 00:52:16,465
You call this guy a bounty hunter?

673
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:19,510
What's he gonna do,
flute those ogres a lullaby?

674
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:33,107
OK, got it!

675
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:36,443
Make it stop!

676
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:42,116
All right, that's enough.

677
00:52:45,453 --> 00:52:49,123
Looks like it's time to pay the piper.

678
00:52:51,293 --> 00:52:54,044
Griselda, seriously,
it's time to pay the piper.

679
00:52:54,212 --> 00:52:57,256
Now go get my chequebook!
Go! Move! Get out!

680
00:52:57,424 --> 00:52:59,425
Things are getting
real sloppy around here!

681
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:02,720
Here, now make sure they eat up!

682
00:53:02,721 --> 00:53:03,053
Here, now make sure they eat up!

683
00:53:03,054 --> 00:53:03,387
Here, now make sure they eat up!

684
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:04,680
Here, now make sure they eat up!

685
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:08,142
You can't end tyranny on
an empty stomach! Go on! Go!

686
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:09,810
Din-din!

687
00:53:17,569 --> 00:53:20,446
- Come on, Donkey.
- One more time, please?

688
00:53:20,614 --> 00:53:22,907
All right, but this is the last time.

689
00:53:24,492 --> 00:53:25,492
Here it comes. Look at him.

690
00:53:30,832 --> 00:53:32,666
I see you!

691
00:53:39,591 --> 00:53:41,467
That's quite a friend you've got there.

692
00:53:41,635 --> 00:53:43,761
I can see why you haven't eaten him.

693
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:46,555
Donkey! I hate to pull you away
from your adoring public,

694
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:49,016
but I'm not getting anywhere with Fiona.

695
00:53:49,184 --> 00:53:52,269
- I need your help!
- Hey, everybody. Who wants dessert?

696
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:57,107
- Where'd you get these?
- Fiona's garbage.

697
00:53:57,275 --> 00:54:00,194
Just another gift from some
clueless lover boy.

698
00:54:01,988 --> 00:54:03,656
That's a good one, Cookie!

699
00:54:04,658 --> 00:54:07,660
Anyone who knows Fiona knows
this stuff ain't gonna work on her.

700
00:54:07,827 --> 00:54:09,328
Works on me.

701
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:12,373
Donkey, what am I gonna do?
It's like I don't even know her.

702
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:15,918
You in trouble, Romeo. The only thing
Fiona cares about is her cause.

703
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:19,088
- To the cause!
- To the cause!

704
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:22,424
All right!

705
00:54:44,906 --> 00:54:45,906
Hello!

706
00:54:49,911 --> 00:54:51,996
- Nice moves.
- What are you doing?

707
00:54:52,163 --> 00:54:54,873
What does it look like?
I'm getting ready for ambush action.

708
00:54:55,041 --> 00:54:57,710
Oh, yeah.
I always like to quad my lutes

709
00:54:57,877 --> 00:55:02,047
and do some scrunches
before an operational... op.

710
00:55:02,215 --> 00:55:03,257
This one taken?

711
00:55:03,425 --> 00:55:05,259
We use that to clean the toilets.

712
00:55:07,178 --> 00:55:10,306
And we use that one to clean
the thing we clean the toilets with.

713
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:11,765
I knew that.

714
00:55:12,851 --> 00:55:13,976
There you go, chief.

715
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:33,287
Hey... Scott?

716
00:55:33,788 --> 00:55:35,622
My name is Shrek, actually.

717
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:38,625
You're going to get yourself killed
at the ambush tonight.

718
00:55:38,793 --> 00:55:42,421
I'll be fine.
I think I can take care of myself...

719
00:55:42,922 --> 00:55:44,173
Well, let's see about that.

720
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:47,051
Hey! Hey... Hey!

721
00:55:47,218 --> 00:55:48,260
What the...?

722
00:55:52,974 --> 00:55:54,308
Fiona?

723
00:56:26,883 --> 00:56:28,175
I got it.

724
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:29,843
Give me your hand.

725
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:33,889
The dragon goes under the bridge,

726
00:56:34,057 --> 00:56:36,308
through the loop and finally...

727
00:56:36,476 --> 00:56:38,060
Into the castle.

728
00:56:46,694 --> 00:56:48,028
Wow.

729
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:51,865
OK. Good.

730
00:56:52,492 --> 00:56:54,201
It seems like you can handle yourself.

731
00:56:54,369 --> 00:56:56,328
- But, Fiona...
- Go get ready for the mission!

732
00:56:56,496 --> 00:56:59,498
- I will, but Fiona...
- That's an order!

733
00:57:10,593 --> 00:57:14,012
All right, let's get those axes
sharpened and weapons packed!

734
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:15,764
Preparation is half the battle!

735
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:21,395
Ogre! Un momento! Un momento!

736
00:57:21,896 --> 00:57:24,440
Ogre, ogre, un momento!

737
00:57:26,067 --> 00:57:27,359
Just give me a minute.

738
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:30,362
Look, Puss, I'm a little
pressed for time.

739
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:33,699
I am not believing
what I have just witnessed.

740
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:35,534
Back there, you and Fiona.

741
00:57:35,702 --> 00:57:38,370
There was a spark...
a spark inside her heart

742
00:57:38,538 --> 00:57:40,247
I thought was long extinguished.

743
00:57:40,415 --> 00:57:44,835
It was as if, for one moment,
Fiona had actually found her true love!

744
00:57:45,003 --> 00:57:48,338
I am her true love. I ended her curse.

745
00:57:48,923 --> 00:57:50,757
You know of her curse?

746
00:57:50,925 --> 00:57:54,219
By day, one way, by night another.

747
00:57:54,387 --> 00:57:57,139
This shall be the norm.

748
00:57:57,307 --> 00:58:00,809
Until you find true love's first kiss...

749
00:58:02,103 --> 00:58:05,981
...and then take love's true form.

750
00:58:06,858 --> 00:58:08,734
You even know the little rhyme!

751
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:11,403
It is true! You are the one!
You must prove it to her!

752
00:58:11,571 --> 00:58:13,739
- How?
- Convince her!

753
00:58:13,907 --> 00:58:15,240
Go to her when she is alone

754
00:58:15,408 --> 00:58:19,077
and tell her something
that only her true love would know.

755
00:58:19,245 --> 00:58:20,787
Know about what?!

756
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:25,918
Whoa! That's a whole lot of kitty!
Shrek, can we keep him?

757
00:58:42,644 --> 00:58:44,478
Excuse me. Coming through!

758
00:58:44,646 --> 00:58:47,356
Pardon me, guys! Watch your back.

759
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:50,400
Look, Donkey,
the chimichanga cart! Quick!

760
00:58:50,568 --> 00:58:53,445
Ándale! After him, burro!
Donkey, vámonos!

761
00:58:53,613 --> 00:58:55,739
Man, you are a cat-astrophe!

762
00:58:55,907 --> 00:58:58,283
And you are ri-donkey-lous!

763
00:59:04,165 --> 00:59:06,959
I'll scout ahead. Wait for my signal.

764
00:59:12,006 --> 00:59:13,882
Secure your positions!

765
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:32,776
- It's quite a view from up here.
- What are you doing?!

766
00:59:32,944 --> 00:59:33,986
Get back in position!

767
00:59:34,153 --> 00:59:37,239
You need to know,
once and for all, who I really am.

768
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:38,865
You are going to ruin everything!

769
00:59:39,033 --> 00:59:41,285
Ruin everything?
Actually, I'm gonna fix everything...

770
00:59:41,452 --> 00:59:44,162
The ogres, Rumpel, your curse.

771
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:47,416
How do you know about my curse?!

772
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:52,004
OK, OK, please, Fiona...
Just hear me out.

773
00:59:52,171 --> 00:59:54,715
I can explain everything.

774
00:59:58,219 --> 01:00:01,013
- Where's Fiona's signal?
- What's she waiting for?

775
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:04,016
- He's going to get away!
- No, he's not.

776
01:00:29,584 --> 01:00:33,378
Listen, I don't know who you are
or how you know about my curse,

777
01:00:33,546 --> 01:00:35,422
but if any of these ogres
find out I'm...

778
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:38,842
- A beautiful princess?
- That is not who I am! Not anymore.

779
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:42,054
- Look, I know you're upset.
- You don't know anything about me.

780
01:00:42,221 --> 01:00:43,889
I know everything about you.

781
01:00:44,057 --> 01:00:47,059
I know you sing so beautifully
that birds explode.

782
01:00:47,226 --> 01:00:49,394
- Big deal.
- I know that when you sign your name,

783
01:00:49,562 --> 01:00:52,230
- you put a heart over the "I".
- So what?

784
01:00:52,398 --> 01:00:54,399
I know that when
you see a shooting star,

785
01:00:54,567 --> 01:00:56,568
you cross your fingers on both hands,

786
01:00:56,736 --> 01:01:00,530
squinch up your nose
and you make a wish.

787
01:01:00,698 --> 01:01:03,575
I know that you don't like the covers
wrapped around your feet,

788
01:01:03,743 --> 01:01:05,410
and I know that you sleep by candlelight

789
01:01:05,578 --> 01:01:07,579
because every time
you close your eyes...

790
01:01:08,623 --> 01:01:11,625
...you're afraid you're gonna
wake up back in that tower.

791
01:01:13,336 --> 01:01:15,462
But, most importantly, Fiona...

792
01:01:16,464 --> 01:01:20,050
...I know that the reason
you turn human every day...

793
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:24,429
...is because you've
never been kissed...

794
01:01:25,848 --> 01:01:26,973
...well...

795
01:01:29,477 --> 01:01:30,644
...by me.

796
01:01:40,196 --> 01:01:44,116
- You move fast.
- It's not me doing the moving.

797
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:48,286
- Why is this happening?!
- Love?

798
01:01:48,454 --> 01:01:51,581
- No, I'm being forced to dance!
- By love!

799
01:01:51,749 --> 01:01:54,501
No, I can't stop myself!

800
01:01:54,669 --> 01:01:57,504
Please! Make it stop!

801
01:01:57,672 --> 01:01:59,840
I can't control myself!

802
01:02:03,678 --> 01:02:06,805
Yeah! Cookie's bringing
the heat out of the kitchen!

803
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:11,518
Oh, no! It's the Piper!

804
01:02:13,688 --> 01:02:17,315
I can't believe I let this happen,
and it's all because of you!

805
01:02:17,483 --> 01:02:21,903
- If you'd just let me kiss you!
- What? You're insane!

806
01:02:36,836 --> 01:02:40,922
We must do something before
they fandango themselves into oblivion!

807
01:02:41,090 --> 01:02:44,509
- What can we do?
- First, you must stop dancing!

808
01:02:44,677 --> 01:02:47,387
When somebody tooties that flutey,
I got to shake my booty!

809
01:02:47,555 --> 01:02:49,181
Then it's up to me!

810
01:02:57,732 --> 01:03:01,568
Hurry! We must get them
away from the music!

811
01:03:03,905 --> 01:03:06,990
Puss and Donkey to the rescue!
We saved the day!

812
01:03:32,683 --> 01:03:35,185
Donkey... Can I borrow your tongue?

813
01:03:35,353 --> 01:03:36,436
Say what?!

814
01:03:37,396 --> 01:03:38,730
No. Hell...

815
01:03:41,192 --> 01:03:44,236
I don't care how big your eyes get,
player, it's not going down.

816
01:03:49,992 --> 01:03:51,076
All right!

817
01:03:51,577 --> 01:03:52,577
Stop!

818
01:03:52,745 --> 01:03:55,247
- Where are you going?
- To save my friends.

819
01:03:55,414 --> 01:03:58,250
- How, by getting yourself killed?
- If that's what it takes.

820
01:03:58,417 --> 01:03:59,709
Puss, say something.

821
01:03:59,877 --> 01:04:01,753
- Puss?
- Let me explain.

822
01:04:01,921 --> 01:04:04,047
That's how you knew so much about me.

823
01:04:04,215 --> 01:04:07,300
- Fiona, wait! Kiss me.
- What?

824
01:04:07,468 --> 01:04:09,094
It's the only way to save your friends.

825
01:04:09,262 --> 01:04:10,220
Get out of my way.

826
01:04:10,388 --> 01:04:13,598
You used to believe that a single kiss
could solve everything!

827
01:04:40,209 --> 01:04:44,421
I don't understand.
This doesn't make any sense.

828
01:04:44,589 --> 01:04:47,215
True love's kiss
was supposed to fix everything!

829
01:04:47,383 --> 01:04:49,467
Yeah, you know,
that's what they told me, too.

830
01:04:49,635 --> 01:04:51,970
True love didn't get me
out of that tower.

831
01:04:52,138 --> 01:04:54,848
I did. I saved myself.

832
01:04:56,017 --> 01:04:59,477
Don't you get it?
It's all just a big fairy tale.

833
01:04:59,645 --> 01:05:02,063
Fiona, don't say that. It does exist!

834
01:05:02,231 --> 01:05:03,607
How would you know?

835
01:05:03,774 --> 01:05:06,484
Did you grow up locked away
in a dragon's keep?

836
01:05:06,652 --> 01:05:09,487
Did you live all alone
in a miserable tower?

837
01:05:09,655 --> 01:05:11,990
Did you cry yourself
to sleep every night,

838
01:05:12,158 --> 01:05:14,743
waiting for a true love
that never came?!

839
01:05:16,037 --> 01:05:19,623
But... But I'm your true love.

840
01:05:19,790 --> 01:05:23,209
Then where were you
when I needed you?

841
01:05:35,056 --> 01:05:37,557
Maybe you kissed her wrong?

842
01:05:38,184 --> 01:05:39,225
No.

843
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:41,561
The kiss didn't work...

844
01:05:42,521 --> 01:05:44,856
...because Fiona doesn't love me.

845
01:05:51,405 --> 01:05:53,114
Don't despair, fellow ogres!

846
01:05:53,282 --> 01:05:57,535
They can put us in cages,
but they can't cage our honour!

847
01:05:58,913 --> 01:06:01,831
Shrek and Fiona are together?!

848
01:06:03,918 --> 01:06:07,170
Yeah, I've heard enough of
your toot-a-lee-toots! You blew it!

849
01:06:07,338 --> 01:06:09,005
Wolfie! My speech wig.

850
01:06:09,173 --> 01:06:13,426
Baba! Ready my makeup.
And Piper, pull my socks up.

851
01:06:15,888 --> 01:06:16,846
Tight.

852
01:06:17,014 --> 01:06:18,515
Attention, citizens.

853
01:06:19,308 --> 01:06:23,603
Please stay tuned for a message
from our tyrannical dictator!

854
01:06:24,981 --> 01:06:28,400
Hello, people.
It is I, Rumpelstiltskin...

855
01:06:28,567 --> 01:06:30,652
...shepherd of your dreams.

856
01:06:32,488 --> 01:06:35,448
Recently, a certain somebody

857
01:06:35,616 --> 01:06:38,952
has jeopardized our joyous lives.

858
01:06:39,912 --> 01:06:44,874
And that somebody
is the rat-munching ogre called Shrek!

859
01:06:45,042 --> 01:06:47,335
That is why I come to you,
dear citizens.

860
01:06:47,503 --> 01:06:50,005
For whomever brings me this ogre,

861
01:06:50,172 --> 01:06:54,467
shall receive the deal of a lifetime.

862
01:06:54,844 --> 01:06:56,261
Just think of it! Total and

863
01:06:56,429 --> 01:06:58,138
- complete happiness.
- Ya!

864
01:06:58,305 --> 01:07:01,766
Dazzling, radiant fulfilment!
All your greatest wishes.

865
01:07:01,934 --> 01:07:03,935
- Yeah!
- Your wildest dreams.

866
01:07:04,103 --> 01:07:08,732
Anything you could ever want!
No strings attached!

867
01:07:09,025 --> 01:07:12,110
But hurry, this is a limited time offer.

868
01:07:12,278 --> 01:07:18,116
So light your torches, sharpen
your pitchforks and get your mob on!

869
01:07:18,617 --> 01:07:21,661
Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!

870
01:07:25,916 --> 01:07:27,959
Go back where you came from!

871
01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:32,756
It seems that we are safe.

872
01:07:32,923 --> 01:07:35,717
Yeah, it looks a lot less pitchforky
and torchy out there. Let's go.

873
01:07:35,885 --> 01:07:39,971
What's the point?
The kiss didn't work. It's over.

874
01:07:40,139 --> 01:07:43,141
Look, Shrek, I know things
might seem a little bleak right now,

875
01:07:43,309 --> 01:07:45,769
but things always work themselves
out in the end, you'll see.

876
01:07:45,936 --> 01:07:48,313
- I bet by this time tomorrow...
- Don't you understand?

877
01:07:48,481 --> 01:07:50,148
There is no tomorrow.

878
01:07:50,316 --> 01:07:54,277
There's no day after that, and there's
no day after that day after that!

879
01:07:54,445 --> 01:07:57,947
My life was perfect
and I'm never going to get it back!

880
01:07:58,115 --> 01:08:01,701
If your life was so perfect, why'd you
sign it away to Rumpelstiltskin?

881
01:08:01,869 --> 01:08:05,246
Because I didn't know
what I had until it was gone! All right?

882
01:08:10,044 --> 01:08:11,878
I didn't know what I had.

883
01:08:14,465 --> 01:08:17,967
Surrender now! I'm taking you in!

884
01:08:18,552 --> 01:08:22,138
Don't try to fight it, ogre!
The reward is mine!

885
01:08:22,306 --> 01:08:23,306
Gingy?

886
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:26,518
- You unhand me, green devil!
- What are you doing?

887
01:08:26,685 --> 01:08:27,977
Collecting my bounty!

888
01:08:28,145 --> 01:08:30,146
- Bounty?
- What are you talking about, cracker?

889
01:08:30,898 --> 01:08:33,358
Rumpelstiltskin promised
the deal of a lifetime

890
01:08:33,526 --> 01:08:36,528
- for whoever could bring you in.
- Deal of a lifetime?

891
01:08:36,695 --> 01:08:39,739
Where all your wishes come true.

892
01:08:41,408 --> 01:08:42,742
Wait a minute.

893
01:08:43,536 --> 01:08:46,246
- I can still fix this.
- How you gonna do that?

894
01:08:46,413 --> 01:08:50,708
You know what? I'm gonna give
Rumpelstiltskin exactly what he wants.

895
01:08:50,876 --> 01:08:53,211
OK, Gingy, tell me about this...

896
01:08:57,591 --> 01:08:59,592
Were you going to eat that?

897
01:09:01,595 --> 01:09:04,681
Not Shrek. That is not Shrek.
Also not Shrek.

898
01:09:04,849 --> 01:09:08,184
That's not even an ogre,
it is a troll! Nice try.

899
01:09:08,352 --> 01:09:09,352
- And that...
- Roar.

900
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:10,520
...is just sad.

901
01:09:11,397 --> 01:09:13,273
And what is that supposed to be?

902
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:15,024
I'm just a frightened old man.

903
01:09:15,192 --> 01:09:18,111
Don't listen to him!
These ogres are crafty!

904
01:09:18,279 --> 01:09:19,904
That is your father painted green.

905
01:09:20,072 --> 01:09:22,115
No, it's Shrek! Honest!

906
01:09:23,659 --> 01:09:24,701
Take them away!

907
01:09:24,869 --> 01:09:27,745
Can no one bring me Shrek?!
Where is he?

908
01:09:27,913 --> 01:09:30,623
How hard can it be?!
I want him! I want him! I want him!

909
01:09:31,125 --> 01:09:32,458
Stiltskin!

910
01:09:34,044 --> 01:09:35,753
I hear you're looking for me.

911
01:09:36,589 --> 01:09:38,548
All right! Finally!

912
01:09:38,716 --> 01:09:42,177
Who turned him in?
Who gets the deal of a lifetime?

913
01:09:42,344 --> 01:09:44,179
- I do.
- What? But...

914
01:09:44,346 --> 01:09:48,266
If I'm turning myself in,
I get the deal of a lifetime.

915
01:09:51,270 --> 01:09:55,023
That means you have
to give me anything I want.

916
01:09:55,191 --> 01:09:57,775
No! Only true love's kiss
can break your contract!

917
01:09:57,943 --> 01:09:59,819
So if you thought you were just gonna...

918
01:10:00,863 --> 01:10:05,116
- ... in here and get your life back...
- I'm not here to get my life back.

919
01:10:05,659 --> 01:10:08,077
Then what do you want?

920
01:10:18,839 --> 01:10:21,341
The ogres. They are all free.

921
01:10:21,508 --> 01:10:23,009
But where is Shrek?

922
01:10:28,182 --> 01:10:30,516
This is not good.

923
01:10:31,644 --> 01:10:35,146
I don't know.
Not much of a storybook ending.

924
01:10:35,314 --> 01:10:41,152
The noble Shrek turns himself in
to save a bunch of filthy ogres.

925
01:10:41,695 --> 01:10:44,364
All that matters is that they're free...

926
01:10:44,865 --> 01:10:46,866
...and Fiona is safe.

927
01:10:48,369 --> 01:10:51,329
I bet Fiona would be
really touched to hear that.

928
01:10:51,997 --> 01:10:53,289
But, hey...

929
01:10:53,457 --> 01:10:56,376
...I guess you can tell her yourself.

930
01:10:57,211 --> 01:10:58,670
Fiona!

931
01:11:07,054 --> 01:11:11,349
Stiltskin, we had a deal!
You agreed to free all ogres!

932
01:11:11,517 --> 01:11:12,767
Oh, yeah.

933
01:11:12,935 --> 01:11:17,563
But Fiona isn't all ogre, is she?

934
01:11:20,567 --> 01:11:26,364
By day, one way, by night, another.
Blardy, blardy, blar.

935
01:11:28,242 --> 01:11:30,451
Nobody's smart but me!

936
01:11:38,585 --> 01:11:41,087
That was a really brave thing
you did, Shrek.

937
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:42,880
Thank you.

938
01:11:43,590 --> 01:11:45,925
No, you were right.

939
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:48,886
I wasn't there for you.

940
01:11:49,054 --> 01:11:51,389
And not just at
the Dragon's Keep, but...

941
01:11:52,725 --> 01:11:54,475
...every day since.

942
01:11:55,436 --> 01:11:56,602
Well...

943
01:11:57,604 --> 01:11:59,230
...you're here now.

944
01:12:01,942 --> 01:12:03,735
Let go of me! I have got to save Shrek!

945
01:12:03,902 --> 01:12:05,278
Don't be a fool, mule!

946
01:12:05,446 --> 01:12:07,947
She's right. Rumpel's palace
is locked up tighter

947
01:12:08,115 --> 01:12:11,409
- than Old Mother Hubbard's Cupboard.
- And that cupboard wasn't guarded

948
01:12:11,577 --> 01:12:14,579
by a whole bunch of
mean, ugly, nasty witches.

949
01:12:14,747 --> 01:12:17,623
Hey! We can hear you!

950
01:12:18,459 --> 01:12:19,959
Sorry!

951
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:23,254
We must get into the palace.

952
01:12:23,422 --> 01:12:25,548
Man, Shrek and me
just busted out of that place!

953
01:12:25,716 --> 01:12:27,258
But how?

954
01:12:28,469 --> 01:12:31,429
The same way we're gonna bust in.

955
01:12:35,893 --> 01:12:40,021
Yay! My new pretty ball!
Didn't it look bigger in the catalogue?

956
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:41,773
I guess it'll have to do.

957
01:12:47,237 --> 01:12:51,949
Witches, finally, the moment
we've all been waiting for.

958
01:12:52,117 --> 01:12:54,911
The main event of the evening!

959
01:12:55,079 --> 01:12:58,247
I present Shrek and Fiona!

960
01:13:03,337 --> 01:13:07,382
And now, to put the past
behind us once and for all,

961
01:13:07,549 --> 01:13:11,302
I give you a princess's worst nightmare!

962
01:13:11,470 --> 01:13:15,056
Fiona's old flame,
the keeper of the keep...

963
01:13:15,224 --> 01:13:16,808
...Dragon!

964
01:13:39,790 --> 01:13:42,083
- Donkey?
- And Puss!

965
01:13:45,879 --> 01:13:47,004
In Boots!

966
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:19,162
Get them, get them, witches!

967
01:14:20,998 --> 01:14:22,540
Incoming!

968
01:14:26,753 --> 01:14:29,130
- Donkey, woo her!
- Woo who?

969
01:14:29,298 --> 01:14:30,673
Your wife!

970
01:14:54,740 --> 01:14:55,865
Uh-oh.

971
01:15:01,371 --> 01:15:04,665
I'll call you! We're in love!

972
01:15:16,428 --> 01:15:17,887
Fiona, hold on!

973
01:15:19,598 --> 01:15:21,224
Hey, you!

974
01:15:50,754 --> 01:15:53,839
- Chimichangas?!
- Get 'em while they're hot!

975
01:16:00,764 --> 01:16:01,973
Jump!

976
01:16:05,435 --> 01:16:06,644
Now!

977
01:16:20,701 --> 01:16:23,327
The dragon goes under the bridge!

978
01:16:24,454 --> 01:16:25,955
Through the loop!

979
01:16:26,123 --> 01:16:27,206
And finally...

980
01:16:27,374 --> 01:16:28,958
Into the castle!

981
01:16:35,632 --> 01:16:37,008
Run!

982
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:44,473
Foo!

983
01:16:46,310 --> 01:16:47,643
So long!

984
01:16:50,522 --> 01:16:51,647
Come on, Fifi, go!

985
01:16:51,815 --> 01:16:53,691
Go! Witches, close up the floor!

986
01:16:54,818 --> 01:16:57,445
Come on, Fifi, go! Flappity flap!

987
01:16:57,613 --> 01:17:00,990
Come on, go! Fly away! Up, up! Go!

988
01:17:01,825 --> 01:17:03,159
Fifi, no!

989
01:17:07,914 --> 01:17:09,832
Victory is ours!

990
01:17:18,216 --> 01:17:21,218
Looks like we're having
curly-toed weirdo for breakfast.

991
01:17:21,386 --> 01:17:23,971
Hey, we make a pretty good team.

992
01:17:24,139 --> 01:17:26,098
You have no idea.

993
01:17:34,024 --> 01:17:35,358
Shrek?

994
01:17:38,153 --> 01:17:41,030
His day is up. His day is...!

995
01:17:41,615 --> 01:17:42,782
Shrek?

996
01:17:43,867 --> 01:17:45,534
It's all right.

997
01:17:49,081 --> 01:17:51,374
There has to be something I can do.

998
01:17:52,209 --> 01:17:55,836
You've already done
everything for me, Fiona.

999
01:17:56,004 --> 01:17:58,589
You gave me a home and a family.

1000
01:17:58,757 --> 01:18:00,508
You have kids?

1001
01:18:00,676 --> 01:18:02,677
We have kids.

1002
01:18:02,844 --> 01:18:06,722
Fergus, Farkle
and a little girl named...

1003
01:18:06,890 --> 01:18:08,224
- ... Felicia.
- Felicia.

1004
01:18:09,101 --> 01:18:11,894
I always wanted to have
a daughter named Felicia.

1005
01:18:12,437 --> 01:18:14,105
And someday...

1006
01:18:15,774 --> 01:18:17,108
...you will.

1007
01:18:27,786 --> 01:18:30,454
You know what the
best part of today was?

1008
01:18:33,083 --> 01:18:37,253
I got the chance to fall in love
with you all over again.

1009
01:19:11,163 --> 01:19:13,998
Fiona, the sunrise!

1010
01:19:14,166 --> 01:19:16,459
You're still... an ogre!

1011
01:19:18,962 --> 01:19:21,922
- True love's form.
- Impossible!

1012
01:19:22,674 --> 01:19:24,341
The kiss worked.

1013
01:19:31,016 --> 01:19:32,349
What?!

1014
01:19:41,777 --> 01:19:43,194
Fifi!

1015
01:19:44,988 --> 01:19:46,322
Puss!

1016
01:19:48,658 --> 01:19:50,409
No, no, no!

1017
01:19:50,577 --> 01:19:53,662
No, not yet! I'm not ready! No, wait!

1018
01:20:07,803 --> 01:20:09,261
I love you, Daddy!

1019
01:20:09,429 --> 01:20:12,681
Shrek! Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!

1020
01:20:17,103 --> 01:20:20,314
Everybody, I have found another cake!

1021
01:20:21,066 --> 01:20:23,359
Shrek? Are you OK?

1022
01:20:29,866 --> 01:20:34,036
Fiona. I've never been better.

1023
01:20:36,206 --> 01:20:37,873
Roar!

1024
01:20:42,712 --> 01:20:45,047
Happy Birthday, Farkle.

1025
01:20:45,215 --> 01:20:47,508
Fergus, my little man!

1026
01:20:47,676 --> 01:20:49,969
And Felicia, sweetheart.

1027
01:20:50,136 --> 01:20:52,388
I believe this is yours.

1028
01:20:53,765 --> 01:20:55,432

Hey, Uncle Shrek! How about
giving my babies an encore!

1030
01:20:59,604 --> 01:21:01,730
Please, seńor, let us have it!

1031
01:21:13,034 --> 01:21:16,495
- I didn't know we could do that.
- That's my best friend!

1032
01:21:17,747 --> 01:21:19,915
You know, I always thought

1033
01:21:20,083 --> 01:21:22,459
that I rescued you
from the Dragon's Keep.

1034
01:21:22,627 --> 01:21:24,003
You did.

1035
01:21:24,170 --> 01:21:27,756
No. It was you that rescued me.

1036
01:22:58,848 --> 01:23:00,182
Yummy!
