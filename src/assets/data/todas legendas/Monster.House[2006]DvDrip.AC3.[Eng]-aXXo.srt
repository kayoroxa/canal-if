1
00:02:05,506 --> 00:02:07,770
Hello, fence.

2
00:02:16,717 --> 00:02:19,208
Hello, leaves.

3
00:02:22,756 --> 00:02:24,849
Hello, sky.

4
00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:31,286
Get off my lawn!

5
00:03:33,193 --> 00:03:35,161
Trespasser.

6
00:03:35,362 --> 00:03:37,489
Do you want to be eaten alive?

7
00:03:38,031 --> 00:03:40,431
-No.
-Then get out of here!

8
00:03:44,905 --> 00:03:46,372
My trike.

9
00:03:52,446 --> 00:03:55,244
Stay away from my house!

10
00:04:17,904 --> 00:04:19,599
-DJ!
-We're gonna be late.

11
00:04:19,806 --> 00:04:21,671
Yeah, Mom, l'm coming.
l'm coming.

12
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:25,644
October 30th, another tricycle.

13
00:04:25,846 --> 00:04:27,575
l'm coming.

14
00:04:32,452 --> 00:04:33,885
Mom.

15
00:04:34,087 --> 00:04:37,181
Mom, he did it again.
He took another tricycle.

16
00:04:37,391 --> 00:04:39,655
Okay, honey,
we've talked about this.

17
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:42,420
You cannot stay up
in your room all day...

18
00:04:42,629 --> 00:04:44,893
...staring at an old man
through a telescope.

19
00:04:45,098 --> 00:04:47,259
But, Mom, there's something wrong
with that house.

20
00:04:47,467 --> 00:04:48,695
l'm serious.

21
00:04:48,902 --> 00:04:50,733
What was that?

22
00:04:52,606 --> 00:04:54,096
l'm serious.

23
00:04:54,775 --> 00:04:56,709
His voice sounds funny.

24
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:59,310
Someone is hitting puberty.

25
00:04:59,513 --> 00:05:02,641
''What's happening to my body?''
Right, buddy?

26
00:05:02,849 --> 00:05:04,339
Maybe you should come with us.

27
00:05:04,551 --> 00:05:07,520
Oh, the boy's too busy.
He's got his spying to do.

28
00:05:07,721 --> 00:05:09,712
l'm not spying.

29
00:05:10,157 --> 00:05:11,488
Well...

30
00:05:11,692 --> 00:05:14,752
''Well...'' That's okay, buddy.

31
00:05:14,961 --> 00:05:17,191
When l was your age,
l did exactly the same thing.

32
00:05:17,397 --> 00:05:20,924
Of course, it was with binoculars
and involved the lovely Jensen twins.

33
00:05:21,134 --> 00:05:24,160
Neither of which was as lovely
as your beautiful mother.

34
00:05:24,371 --> 00:05:26,805
Will you be an angel
and help me bring out the incisor?

35
00:05:27,007 --> 00:05:28,201
-The incisor.
-Hold this.

36
00:05:28,408 --> 00:05:30,603
Yeah, you don't wanna forget that.

37
00:05:38,485 --> 00:05:40,476
Elizabeth will be here
in a few hours.

38
00:05:40,687 --> 00:05:42,917
lf anything happens,
call the police and hide.

39
00:05:43,123 --> 00:05:44,590
He knows that.

40
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:47,191
See you tomorrow night.

41
00:05:47,394 --> 00:05:50,363
-What have you done?
-Just let me drive this thing, will you?

42
00:05:50,564 --> 00:05:52,122
-Where is DJ? Where's DJ?
-l'm fine.

43
00:05:52,332 --> 00:05:56,063
You would be so happy
if he was under the car, wouldn't you?

44
00:05:56,269 --> 00:06:00,467
Sorry. lt's hard to see
with the mask on.

45
00:06:00,674 --> 00:06:03,165
Then why don't you keep it off,
Chowder?

46
00:06:03,377 --> 00:06:05,208
Why did you put up your window?

47
00:06:05,412 --> 00:06:07,175
-Chowder.
-lt's aerodynamic.

48
00:06:07,381 --> 00:06:08,848
-Hi, DJ.
-We've got to make time.

49
00:06:09,049 --> 00:06:10,482
The children. The children.

50
00:06:10,684 --> 00:06:12,447
-What children?
-Bye-bye, baby.

51
00:06:12,652 --> 00:06:14,984
-Tell him you love him, dear.
-He knows that.

52
00:06:15,188 --> 00:06:17,713
-Tell your son you love him.
-l don't wanna tell him.

53
00:06:17,924 --> 00:06:19,482
-He knows l love him.
-He's your son.

54
00:06:19,693 --> 00:06:22,890
-You have to say it. Roll it down.
-We're gonna be late.

55
00:06:23,697 --> 00:06:25,255
We both love you.

56
00:06:25,465 --> 00:06:27,831
-That includes your dad.
-That's right.

57
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:32,067
-He's had enough kisses.
-Blow him a kiss.

58
00:06:32,272 --> 00:06:34,103
-Blow him a kiss.
-Goodbye.

59
00:06:38,211 --> 00:06:40,771
Cheer up.
lt's almost Halloween.

60
00:06:40,981 --> 00:06:44,109
ln one day and three hours,
it's candy time.

61
00:06:45,185 --> 00:06:46,652
Okay?

62
00:06:47,721 --> 00:06:50,918
-Check it out, l got a new ball.
-Cool.

63
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:55,120
Oh, speaking of which,
have you decided?

64
00:06:55,328 --> 00:06:58,695
Skullzor or Crypt Keeper?

65
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,390
Chowder.

66
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:05,604
l don't think l'm going
trick-or-treating this year.

67
00:07:05,806 --> 00:07:07,171
What?

68
00:07:07,374 --> 00:07:09,842
Come on, you're gonna break
a six-year streak.

69
00:07:10,043 --> 00:07:12,705
Yeah, six years of being jumped
and egged.

70
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,373
Maybe l'm getting too grown-up.

71
00:07:25,192 --> 00:07:27,092
Three seconds on the clock.

72
00:07:27,294 --> 00:07:29,125
l'm playing basketball.

73
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:36,598
lt's time
for an in-your-face disgrace.

74
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:42,808
-Are you okay?
-My nose is in my brains.

75
00:07:43,009 --> 00:07:44,772
Let me see. Oh, my God.

76
00:07:44,978 --> 00:07:47,412
-What?
-You're a dork.

77
00:07:48,482 --> 00:07:49,676
Where's my ball?

78
00:07:54,754 --> 00:07:56,187
Oh, no.

79
00:08:13,106 --> 00:08:16,598
-Sorry, man.
-Wait, wait. DJ.

80
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:19,108
You're a grownup now,
you go get it.

81
00:08:19,312 --> 00:08:22,509
Chowder, your ball just landed
on Nebbercracker's lawn.

82
00:08:22,716 --> 00:08:25,048
lt doesn't exist anymore.

83
00:08:29,756 --> 00:08:32,657
l paid $28 for that ball.

84
00:08:32,893 --> 00:08:37,193
l raked 10 yards and asked my mom
for a dollar 26 times.

85
00:08:37,697 --> 00:08:40,393
l never worked that hard in my life--

86
00:08:42,035 --> 00:08:43,935
Nebbercracker hasn't come out yet.

87
00:08:44,271 --> 00:08:47,707
-So?
-So maybe he's sleeping.

88
00:08:49,876 --> 00:08:51,468
All right, l'll do it.

89
00:08:51,945 --> 00:08:54,675
l'll never forget this. Hurry, though.

90
00:09:00,053 --> 00:09:01,418
Go.

91
00:09:10,997 --> 00:09:11,986
You.

92
00:09:12,232 --> 00:09:13,927
-No.
-DJ, run!

93
00:09:16,603 --> 00:09:18,332
Get the ball and run!

94
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:22,975
You're so close.

95
00:09:23,176 --> 00:09:24,666
What have you done?

96
00:09:24,878 --> 00:09:26,675
-Just nudge it over here.
-l'm so sorry.

97
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,440
Oh, l'm so, so, so sorry.
l didn't mean--

98
00:09:29,649 --> 00:09:31,207
You are dead.

99
00:09:31,418 --> 00:09:33,283
DJ, come on, come on!

100
00:09:34,988 --> 00:09:36,478
-Chowder.
-Come on, DJ.

101
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:38,351
Help. Chowder.

102
00:09:38,558 --> 00:09:40,287
Help. Help.

103
00:09:41,494 --> 00:09:45,191
-You think you can terrorize my lawn?
-No, l'm sorry.

104
00:09:45,398 --> 00:09:47,525
-You wanna be a dead person?
-No. l love life.

105
00:09:47,734 --> 00:09:50,760
This place is not
a playground for children.

106
00:09:50,971 --> 00:09:53,804
-Got it from now on.
-This is my house!

107
00:09:54,007 --> 00:09:55,702
Why can't you respect that?

108
00:09:55,909 --> 00:09:59,606
Why can't you
just stay away from--?

109
00:11:20,593 --> 00:11:22,220
Push.

110
00:11:50,156 --> 00:11:53,683
No siren. Never a good sign.

111
00:12:03,737 --> 00:12:05,170
l'm a murderer.

112
00:12:05,505 --> 00:12:07,973
-No, you're not.
-l'm not?

113
00:12:08,174 --> 00:12:11,109
When it's an accident,
they call it manslaughter.

114
00:12:11,611 --> 00:12:13,806
l think l'm gonna throw up.

115
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:18,747
Great. Babysitter's here.

116
00:12:18,952 --> 00:12:21,216
See you, DJ.

117
00:12:21,755 --> 00:12:23,518
Perfect.

118
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,788
DJ.

119
00:12:28,995 --> 00:12:32,954
Hey, DJ, l just saw an ambulance.
Did l miss anything interesting?

120
00:12:35,802 --> 00:12:37,326
Hello?

121
00:12:38,805 --> 00:12:40,033
Elizabeth...

122
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,498
...can l talk to you
about something?

123
00:12:42,709 --> 00:12:45,678
Oh, yeah, of course you can,
cantaloupe.

124
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:48,677
We are gonna have
the bestest time.

125
00:12:48,882 --> 00:12:52,181
-Got tons of neat activities planned.
-They already left.

126
00:12:52,385 --> 00:12:55,013
-They did? They're gone?
-Yes, and l need to talk to you.

127
00:12:55,221 --> 00:12:58,054
So the usual deal indoors by 9,
in your room by 11.

128
00:12:58,258 --> 00:12:59,919
-Lights out, your call.
-Elizabeth.

129
00:13:00,126 --> 00:13:02,390
-And it's Zee.
-''Zee''?

130
00:13:02,595 --> 00:13:06,258
Now, listen up. l control the TV,
the stereo and the phone.

131
00:13:06,466 --> 00:13:09,697
l don't do board games,
Shrinky Dinks or tuck-ins.

132
00:13:09,903 --> 00:13:12,098
l'm not your mother.
l'm not your friend.

133
00:13:12,305 --> 00:13:16,435
Don't talk to me like l'm a baby, okay?
l am practically a grownup.

134
00:13:16,643 --> 00:13:19,271
l don't even need you here,
Elizabeth.

135
00:13:28,154 --> 00:13:31,681
-Gosh, DJ, why'd you break that?
-But l didn't.

136
00:13:31,891 --> 00:13:34,587
Yeah, let me ask you something.
Who are they gonna believe?

137
00:13:34,794 --> 00:13:36,728
-Go to your room.
-Fine.

138
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,101
Hello?

139
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:32,277
Hello?

140
00:15:36,316 --> 00:15:37,908
Hello?

141
00:15:38,117 --> 00:15:40,711
Yeah, very funny.
See how you like it.

142
00:16:18,257 --> 00:16:20,953
Happy Halloween, doofus.

143
00:16:21,961 --> 00:16:23,428
Nice one, Bones.

144
00:16:23,629 --> 00:16:26,097
Look at his face. That's funny.

145
00:16:27,033 --> 00:16:30,264
You're not supposed
to have friends over. Who's this?

146
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:31,869
-This is Bones.
-What's up?

147
00:16:32,071 --> 00:16:33,629
-He's in a band.
-That's right.

148
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:37,970
And, anyway, cantaloupe,
let's not open up the rulebook, okay?

149
00:16:38,177 --> 00:16:40,543
Since you're up
way past your bedtime.

150
00:16:40,747 --> 00:16:43,648
No, no, no, this is different. Listen.

151
00:16:51,891 --> 00:16:55,088
You called the neighbors.
Good for you.

152
00:16:55,294 --> 00:16:56,955
l used star-69. He called me.

153
00:16:57,163 --> 00:16:58,892
-Who called you?
-Nebbercracker.

154
00:16:59,332 --> 00:17:01,459
P.S., he died today.

155
00:17:01,667 --> 00:17:02,964
-You lie.
-Do not.

156
00:17:03,169 --> 00:17:05,865
He died, and now l'm getting
phone calls from his house.

157
00:17:07,407 --> 00:17:10,501
A phone call
from beyond the grave.

158
00:17:15,081 --> 00:17:18,414
Guys, come on. l'm serious.

159
00:17:18,618 --> 00:17:20,609
Oh, he's serious.
Did you know he was serious?

160
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:24,984
-Come on, man, give her back.
-Oh, ''her''? You mind?

161
00:17:25,191 --> 00:17:27,091
Oh, come on. Gross.

162
00:17:27,293 --> 00:17:29,989
-Come on, Bones.
-Wait, hold on, dude. l th--

163
00:17:30,196 --> 00:17:33,324
She's having trouble breathing.
Might have something in her throat.

164
00:17:33,533 --> 00:17:34,830
All right, l'll look into it.

165
00:17:35,034 --> 00:17:37,298
-No. Elizabeth. No.
-Okay, Bones, knock it off.

166
00:17:37,503 --> 00:17:40,301
Downstairs, now.

167
00:17:40,773 --> 00:17:43,970
Sorry, kid, can't play anymore.

168
00:17:45,945 --> 00:17:48,140
You are so funny.

169
00:17:48,347 --> 00:17:51,282
l know. lt's like l don't even try
and it just happens.

170
00:18:14,974 --> 00:18:17,374
God, stop doing this.

171
00:18:19,745 --> 00:18:22,339
Oh, yeah? What you gonna do?

172
00:18:24,117 --> 00:18:27,245
-Homicide.
-Chowder, where are your parents?

173
00:18:27,453 --> 00:18:28,715
My dad's at the pharmacy...

174
00:18:28,921 --> 00:18:31,446
...and my mom's at the movies
with her personal trainer.

175
00:18:31,657 --> 00:18:35,024
-Meet me at the Danger Zone now.
-Fine.

176
00:18:36,062 --> 00:18:41,261
-Bones, l said, knock it off.
-Come on, man.

177
00:18:41,467 --> 00:18:43,662
No, l'm creeped out.

178
00:18:44,971 --> 00:18:47,439
You know,
l saw an ambulance here today.

179
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,607
So?

180
00:18:48,808 --> 00:18:52,767
So maybe Nebbercracker
really did die.

181
00:18:52,979 --> 00:18:56,176
We should be so lucky.
The guy is evil.

182
00:18:56,382 --> 00:18:58,782
No, he's just a crotchety old dude.

183
00:18:58,985 --> 00:19:01,818
Oh, really, Zee?

184
00:19:02,221 --> 00:19:07,887
When l was 10 years old,
l had a kite. Awesome kite.

185
00:19:08,094 --> 00:19:11,552
l could fly it so high
you couldn't see it.

186
00:19:11,764 --> 00:19:15,291
One day, it crashed down.

187
00:19:15,501 --> 00:19:20,461
l followed the string
and it ended right over there...

188
00:19:20,673 --> 00:19:23,198
...across the street,
right at the edge of his lawn.

189
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:32,312
Did he take your kite?

190
00:19:32,518 --> 00:19:35,817
Yeah, he takes whatever lands
on his lawn.

191
00:19:36,022 --> 00:19:37,990
But that's not the point.

192
00:19:38,191 --> 00:19:42,787
The point is, is that l saw him
talking to his house...

193
00:19:42,995 --> 00:19:46,158
...and kissing it.

194
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,762
Besides...

195
00:19:49,268 --> 00:19:51,202
...everybody knows
what he did to his wife.

196
00:19:51,404 --> 00:19:53,804
Why? What--?
What did he do to her?

197
00:19:54,207 --> 00:19:58,735
-He ate her.
-Bones. Get off. Stop it!

198
00:19:59,845 --> 00:20:02,211
-Bones, enough.
-Come on, Zee.

199
00:20:02,415 --> 00:20:04,212
Bones, l'm so sick of you.

200
00:20:04,417 --> 00:20:06,977
-l was just--
-You have no respect for women.

201
00:20:07,186 --> 00:20:08,744
What? What does that mean?

202
00:20:08,955 --> 00:20:10,252
Get out.

203
00:20:11,357 --> 00:20:12,551
Fine.

204
00:20:17,363 --> 00:20:18,762
Prude.

205
00:20:26,272 --> 00:20:28,433
What are you looking at?

206
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:32,400
Nebbercracker.

207
00:20:52,231 --> 00:20:54,461
You really are dead, aren't you?

208
00:21:00,373 --> 00:21:03,171
l'm on your lawn, Nebbercracker.

209
00:21:03,809 --> 00:21:07,210
What are you gonna
do about it, Nebbercracker?

210
00:21:08,581 --> 00:21:12,449
Nebber-snapper-flipper-dipper--

211
00:21:24,563 --> 00:21:26,531
My awesome kite.

212
00:22:28,527 --> 00:22:29,585
Chowder.

213
00:22:31,497 --> 00:22:32,555
Chowder.

214
00:22:38,104 --> 00:22:39,696
Chowder?

215
00:22:40,773 --> 00:22:42,331
Chowder.

216
00:22:53,686 --> 00:22:54,846
Heat seeker.

217
00:22:55,054 --> 00:22:56,954
Chowder, what are you doing?

218
00:22:58,491 --> 00:22:59,480
Shut up.

219
00:22:59,792 --> 00:23:00,781
What?

220
00:23:01,227 --> 00:23:03,388
Nebbercracker's back
from the dead.

221
00:23:03,596 --> 00:23:06,394
-No way.
-Yeah.

222
00:23:06,599 --> 00:23:10,160
They leave the keys in here.
You dare me?

223
00:23:10,369 --> 00:23:13,031
Chowder,
you're not listening to me.

224
00:23:13,239 --> 00:23:16,333
Nebbercracker's haunting me,
all right? His blood is on my hands.

225
00:23:16,709 --> 00:23:19,269
And now he's
coming back for revenge.

226
00:23:19,478 --> 00:23:22,208
You're really crazy right now.
Have you noticed that?

227
00:23:22,848 --> 00:23:26,249
l think you're just freaking out
because you killed a guy today.

228
00:23:26,452 --> 00:23:28,352
Life goes on.

229
00:23:28,854 --> 00:23:30,845
For you.

230
00:23:31,056 --> 00:23:34,719
Try and relax. Be cool, like me.

231
00:23:35,961 --> 00:23:37,861
Chowder, what are you doing?

232
00:23:38,063 --> 00:23:39,325
Make it stop.

233
00:23:40,232 --> 00:23:42,826
Quit screwing around.

234
00:23:43,235 --> 00:23:45,032
l need your help.

235
00:23:45,237 --> 00:23:46,465
Fine.

236
00:23:46,939 --> 00:23:48,270
You want my help?

237
00:23:48,474 --> 00:23:50,965
-Yeah.
-l got three words for you.

238
00:23:51,177 --> 00:23:54,704
''Trick or treat.''

239
00:23:56,982 --> 00:24:00,145
Okay. Whatever. Let's go.

240
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:05,814
Hold on.

241
00:24:10,129 --> 00:24:11,721
Chowder, come on.

242
00:24:19,104 --> 00:24:21,095
The haunting is subtle...

243
00:24:21,674 --> 00:24:23,039
...yet really, really boring.

244
00:24:23,242 --> 00:24:25,210
-Can l go home now?
-Chowder, he'll hear you.

245
00:24:25,411 --> 00:24:26,810
DJ...

246
00:24:27,913 --> 00:24:31,576
...this is why nobody
will sit next to us at lunch.

247
00:24:31,784 --> 00:24:35,618
l'll go Ding Dong Ditch the house
and you'll see. No ghost.

248
00:24:35,821 --> 00:24:37,482
Chowder, stop, please.

249
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:38,714
Chowder, l'm serious.

250
00:24:39,291 --> 00:24:41,657
Chowder, come back.
Come back here, please, Chowder.

251
00:24:41,861 --> 00:24:43,351
Come on.

252
00:24:50,669 --> 00:24:52,933
Chowder. Come back.

253
00:24:58,444 --> 00:25:02,210
-Oh, no. A bottle.
-Chowder, put that down.

254
00:25:02,414 --> 00:25:04,905
-Come back, please.
-Bottle.

255
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:26,131
Hey, DJ, who am l?

256
00:25:26,505 --> 00:25:28,769
Get off my lawn.

257
00:25:29,141 --> 00:25:30,506
Don't. Come on.

258
00:26:06,579 --> 00:26:08,843
Run. Chowder, get out of there.

259
00:26:09,048 --> 00:26:10,538
-Chowder, come here.
-Mommy.

260
00:26:10,749 --> 00:26:11,841
This way. This way.

261
00:26:12,051 --> 00:26:13,177
Help.

262
00:26:13,385 --> 00:26:15,649
Come on, Chowder!
Chowder, this way!

263
00:26:24,496 --> 00:26:26,191
Don't look back.

264
00:26:28,534 --> 00:26:30,468
l looked back.

265
00:26:44,783 --> 00:26:46,478
Bones?

266
00:26:46,685 --> 00:26:48,175
Coming.

267
00:26:49,288 --> 00:26:52,815
Don't even think
about crawling back here...

268
00:26:54,827 --> 00:26:56,852
Trick or treat.

269
00:27:04,269 --> 00:27:05,258
What?

270
00:27:06,705 --> 00:27:07,763
Good morning, ma'am.

271
00:27:07,973 --> 00:27:10,601
You witnessed a simulation
of what you'll face this evening.

272
00:27:10,809 --> 00:27:13,505
Studies show that households
that run out of candy...

273
00:27:13,712 --> 00:27:16,704
...are 55 percent more likely
to be TP'd.

274
00:27:16,915 --> 00:27:18,507
To help avert this tragedy...

275
00:27:18,717 --> 00:27:22,016
...l'm here selling Halloween candy
for my school, Westbrook Prep.

276
00:27:22,221 --> 00:27:25,588
Good school.
l got kicked out of there.

277
00:27:25,791 --> 00:27:27,952
Now, what do you want?

278
00:27:28,193 --> 00:27:32,186
Just trying to get a head start on life
and secure a successful future.

279
00:27:32,498 --> 00:27:34,989
You want a successful future?

280
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,668
When a guy with tattoos
comes up to the drive-through...

281
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:41,567
...give him his burger,
not your phone number.

282
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:44,738
Thank you for the advice.
l'll be sure to make a note of it.

283
00:27:44,943 --> 00:27:49,903
But back to business.
Eggs, shaving cream, toilet paper.

284
00:27:50,249 --> 00:27:54,310
Without candy, l'm afraid your house
is a bull's-eye with shingles.

285
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:57,887
Nice try. lt's not my house.

286
00:27:58,090 --> 00:27:59,114
Babysitter?

287
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:01,992
Okay, let's cut the crap.

288
00:28:02,194 --> 00:28:06,494
Maybe the parents you work for
left you $40 in emergency money.

289
00:28:06,699 --> 00:28:08,633
Maybe they left me 30.

290
00:28:09,101 --> 00:28:13,538
Maybe you give me 20, l write
a receipt for 30 and you pocket 10.

291
00:28:13,739 --> 00:28:14,728
Maybe.

292
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:19,070
And l want two extra bags
of peanut clusters.

293
00:28:19,278 --> 00:28:23,180
One bag and l'll
toss in a licorice whip.

294
00:28:24,249 --> 00:28:25,238
You're good.

295
00:28:36,929 --> 00:28:39,557
Eight a.m. No detectable movement.

296
00:28:39,765 --> 00:28:41,460
No detectable movement.

297
00:28:42,401 --> 00:28:45,393
Hey, DJ, l brought you
some chocolate.

298
00:28:48,574 --> 00:28:49,939
Cover blown?

299
00:28:57,649 --> 00:28:59,310
No detectable movement.

300
00:28:59,518 --> 00:29:01,645
What are you two weirdoes up to?

301
00:29:01,854 --> 00:29:03,151
Oh, nothing.

302
00:29:03,355 --> 00:29:06,324
Just something in the house
across the street just tried to eat us.

303
00:29:06,525 --> 00:29:10,017
Yeah. We've been watching all night.
We haven't even left this room once.

304
00:29:10,229 --> 00:29:12,857
Not even to go to the bathroom.
Don't drink that.

305
00:29:13,065 --> 00:29:15,431
Oh, gross.

306
00:29:15,634 --> 00:29:17,727
Whatever disease you guys have...

307
00:29:17,936 --> 00:29:20,962
...l'm sure it's got letters
and that they make pills for it.

308
00:29:21,173 --> 00:29:24,836
Zee, it's true. There's something evil
going on across the street.

309
00:29:25,043 --> 00:29:27,375
That's excellent.
l'm really happy for you.

310
00:29:27,579 --> 00:29:32,812
Anyway, have you two astronomers
seen Bones?

311
00:29:33,018 --> 00:29:35,486
He left last night unexpectedly...

312
00:29:36,922 --> 00:29:39,083
...and he never came back.

313
00:29:39,291 --> 00:29:40,519
Never came back?

314
00:29:42,661 --> 00:29:45,186
-Bottle.
-Of course.

315
00:29:45,397 --> 00:29:48,560
Oh, okay, you know what?
l don't have time for this.

316
00:29:48,767 --> 00:29:51,395
Listen, Zee, l don't know
how to tell you this--

317
00:29:51,603 --> 00:29:54,037
Your boyfriend has most likely
been eaten alive.

318
00:29:55,641 --> 00:29:58,007
Sherry Klausen.

319
00:29:58,377 --> 00:29:59,435
l gotta go.

320
00:29:59,645 --> 00:30:00,839
Breakfast.

321
00:30:01,046 --> 00:30:03,344
Happy Halloween, losers.

322
00:30:26,805 --> 00:30:28,466
Hello.

323
00:30:28,674 --> 00:30:29,698
What?

324
00:30:30,275 --> 00:30:31,299
What is it?

325
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:32,738
Oh, nothing.

326
00:30:32,945 --> 00:30:34,412
Let me see.

327
00:30:54,132 --> 00:30:56,066
-Oh, no.
-Oh, no.

328
00:30:56,268 --> 00:30:58,896
-No. No. Hey.
-Hey, wait. Hey.

329
00:30:59,104 --> 00:31:01,129
DJ, that's your phone.

330
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:03,399
-No, stop.
-Girl. Hey.

331
00:31:03,609 --> 00:31:05,474
-Don't go in there.
-Hold it.

332
00:31:06,879 --> 00:31:07,937
Don't go any further.

333
00:31:08,313 --> 00:31:10,577
-Come here.
-Yes, over here.

334
00:31:12,117 --> 00:31:14,779
Are you guys mentally challenged?

335
00:31:14,987 --> 00:31:18,479
lf you are,
l'm certified to teach you baseball.

336
00:31:19,424 --> 00:31:21,415
Detectable movement.

337
00:31:31,169 --> 00:31:33,763
-What do we do? What do we do?
-Come on.

338
00:31:36,675 --> 00:31:38,199
Guys.

339
00:31:39,177 --> 00:31:40,838
-Run, Chowder.
-l'm running.

340
00:31:42,414 --> 00:31:44,211
Help, please.

341
00:31:46,485 --> 00:31:48,043
-Got her.
-No, l got her.

342
00:31:50,055 --> 00:31:51,818
Hello?

343
00:31:57,462 --> 00:31:59,396
-Hey.
-Oh, my God.

344
00:31:59,598 --> 00:32:04,058
There's an angry dad on the phone
looking for the one called Chowder.

345
00:32:06,505 --> 00:32:07,631
Hello?

346
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:10,171
Losers, l'm talking to you.

347
00:32:14,212 --> 00:32:16,043
He's worried about you.

348
00:32:16,248 --> 00:32:18,079
He should be.

349
00:32:18,617 --> 00:32:22,109
-Start explaining.
-All right, the house, it tried to eat us.

350
00:32:22,321 --> 00:32:25,415
-Stop explaining, l've had enough.
-Wait, wait, where are you going?

351
00:32:25,624 --> 00:32:28,184
To see what's happening
with that stupid house of yours.

352
00:32:28,393 --> 00:32:30,987
-No, no, no. You can't.
-What is your problem?

353
00:32:32,597 --> 00:32:35,862
Puberty. Yeah, l'm having
lots and lots of puberty.

354
00:32:39,237 --> 00:32:41,398
-No more Mountain Dew.
-Right.

355
00:32:41,606 --> 00:32:42,698
l'm going to find Bones.

356
00:32:42,908 --> 00:32:45,570
All right, you have fun.
Don't worry about us, we'll be fine.

357
00:32:45,777 --> 00:32:48,837
And you tell him l said hey, okay?
Safe driving.

358
00:32:49,181 --> 00:32:50,808
See you!

359
00:32:54,286 --> 00:32:55,446
Oh, hi.

360
00:32:55,654 --> 00:32:57,417
You wanna tell me what's going on?

361
00:32:57,622 --> 00:32:59,886
Oh, yeah. l made
the whole puberty thing up.

362
00:33:01,393 --> 00:33:04,089
Hi, l'm JD. DJ.

363
00:33:06,398 --> 00:33:09,799
Yes, Dad, l meant to call you,
but l forgot.

364
00:33:10,002 --> 00:33:12,664
Okay, l'm sorry.

365
00:33:12,871 --> 00:33:14,771
Okay.

366
00:33:14,973 --> 00:33:16,804
Absolutely.

367
00:33:17,009 --> 00:33:18,374
Affirmative.

368
00:33:18,577 --> 00:33:19,976
-Okay, love you. Bye.
-Yeah.

369
00:33:20,178 --> 00:33:25,115
And this is
our little observation post...

370
00:33:25,817 --> 00:33:28,081
...such as it were.

371
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:30,247
Yeah, posters are stupid.

372
00:33:30,455 --> 00:33:32,923
l was gonna tear them down
and put up some art.

373
00:33:33,125 --> 00:33:36,253
Well, Dad, why don't you
kiss my hairy butt?

374
00:33:36,461 --> 00:33:38,622
Hey, DJ, you got any beer?

375
00:33:39,131 --> 00:33:40,655
Well, hello there.

376
00:33:40,866 --> 00:33:42,026
This is Chowder.

377
00:33:42,234 --> 00:33:43,496
Charles, to the ladies.

378
00:33:43,702 --> 00:33:45,169
Jenny Bennett.

379
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:47,497
Two-term class president
at Westbrook Prep.

380
00:33:47,706 --> 00:33:51,198
-That's a tough school to get into.
-Yeah, l got in, but decided not to go.

381
00:33:51,676 --> 00:33:54,042
lt's a girls' school.

382
00:33:56,181 --> 00:33:58,809
Which is why l didn't.

383
00:33:59,618 --> 00:34:02,644
You know, there's a...
There's a great taco stand near there.

384
00:34:02,854 --> 00:34:03,821
l hate Mexican food.

385
00:34:04,022 --> 00:34:05,489
-Me too.
-Me too.

386
00:34:11,163 --> 00:34:13,495
Fascinating, isn't it?

387
00:34:13,698 --> 00:34:16,189
Just sits there waiting...

388
00:34:17,302 --> 00:34:19,827
...mocking us with its...

389
00:34:21,339 --> 00:34:22,636
...houseness.

390
00:34:22,941 --> 00:34:24,932
-May l please use your phone?
-Yeah, sure.

391
00:34:25,143 --> 00:34:26,201
Here. Who you calling?

392
00:34:26,411 --> 00:34:27,503
-My mother.
-Rude.

393
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:29,270
She's probably
not gonna believe you.

394
00:34:29,481 --> 00:34:31,540
lt's too much for the adult mind
to comprehend.

395
00:34:33,452 --> 00:34:38,048
ls this pee? Because if it is,
that's really gross.

396
00:34:38,623 --> 00:34:40,818
-lt's--
-DJ?

397
00:34:41,026 --> 00:34:42,857
You pee in bottles?

398
00:34:43,061 --> 00:34:45,188
What are you talking about?
That one's your pee.

399
00:34:45,397 --> 00:34:46,386
-lt's yours.
-lt's his.

400
00:34:46,598 --> 00:34:48,293
-May l speak with Allison?
-Unsanitary.

401
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,400
-Her daughter. Thank you.
-lt's his pee.

402
00:34:50,602 --> 00:34:51,661
Excuse me.

403
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:56,569
l was selling chocolates in Mayville,
and, well, it's kind of confusing.

404
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:01,873
So you hate Mexican food, huh?

405
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,445
Yeah. You too, huh?

406
00:35:03,815 --> 00:35:06,978
Yeah, in fact, you might say
l started hating it first.

407
00:35:07,185 --> 00:35:09,881
Outside in front of the house?

408
00:35:10,255 --> 00:35:13,122
-Fine. Let's get technical.
-Okay.

409
00:35:13,325 --> 00:35:15,259
l started hating it
through the telescope.

410
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:17,451
Can't call dibs on a girl
through a telescope.

411
00:35:17,662 --> 00:35:19,152
You can't call dibs on a girl.

412
00:35:19,364 --> 00:35:20,888
-Just did.
-Me too.

413
00:35:21,099 --> 00:35:22,327
She didn't believe me.

414
00:35:22,534 --> 00:35:25,128
Authority can be so.

415
00:35:31,543 --> 00:35:35,035
Okay. Normally l don't spend time
with guys like you.

416
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:39,940
But a house just tried to eat me,
so you've got one hour.

417
00:35:45,056 --> 00:35:47,547
Oh, a puppy.

418
00:35:54,733 --> 00:35:56,564
Didn't see that coming.

419
00:35:57,169 --> 00:35:58,796
Okay...

420
00:35:59,471 --> 00:36:01,666
...l think it's time to call the police.

421
00:36:09,714 --> 00:36:12,342
Do you realize
what's gonna happen tonight?

422
00:36:12,551 --> 00:36:15,418
Hundreds of kids
walking right up to that house.

423
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:18,589
Wait, wait, wait. Come on.
Guys, l think we're overreacting.

424
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:19,757
Think about it.

425
00:36:19,958 --> 00:36:24,258
Only a total moron would walk
up to old man Nebbercracker's house.

426
00:36:29,935 --> 00:36:30,924
-Hey, my ball.
-Chowder.

427
00:36:31,136 --> 00:36:32,330
No.

428
00:36:39,477 --> 00:36:41,468
lt's gonna be a bloodbath.

429
00:36:43,915 --> 00:36:45,576
Good news. The cops are here.

430
00:36:46,318 --> 00:36:48,081
All right, kids, this better be good.

431
00:36:48,286 --> 00:36:51,949
l was in the forest wrestling
with a bear claw when we got the call.

432
00:36:56,228 --> 00:36:57,820
l was eating a doughnut.

433
00:36:58,563 --> 00:37:01,623
All three of you,
step to the car now.

434
00:37:01,833 --> 00:37:03,460
-My ears.
-They're at the car.

435
00:37:03,668 --> 00:37:06,296
He's a rookie.
First week on the job.

436
00:37:06,504 --> 00:37:08,062
Officer, we have reason
to believe...

437
00:37:08,273 --> 00:37:10,434
...there's a dangerous creature
inside that house.

438
00:37:10,642 --> 00:37:12,507
-lt may have killed a man.
-And a dog.

439
00:37:12,711 --> 00:37:15,305
Doggy down?
We've got a situation.

440
00:37:15,513 --> 00:37:18,004
-We've got a situation.
-What are you doing?

441
00:37:18,216 --> 00:37:20,184
Calling for backup.
Didn't you hear the kid?

442
00:37:20,385 --> 00:37:22,410
There's a dangerous creature
inside that house.

443
00:37:22,621 --> 00:37:26,421
We don't have backup.
lt's just Judy at the station.

444
00:37:26,758 --> 00:37:27,850
And this is no situation.

445
00:37:28,059 --> 00:37:31,085
lt's just a couple Tater Tots
hopped up on too many Pixy Stix.

446
00:37:31,296 --> 00:37:33,321
l bet you the dead dog
would beg to differ.

447
00:37:33,531 --> 00:37:34,930
What was that?

448
00:37:35,133 --> 00:37:36,464
Nothing.

449
00:37:37,736 --> 00:37:39,033
All right. Time's up, peewees.

450
00:37:39,237 --> 00:37:42,502
-lt's Halloween. We got things to do.
-We do?

451
00:37:42,707 --> 00:37:46,302
No, wait, you can't.
All right, this thing, it has a mouth...

452
00:37:46,511 --> 00:37:49,810
...and it comes out and grabs things
and pulls them in and eats them.

453
00:37:50,015 --> 00:37:51,073
Yeah, like this.

454
00:37:51,283 --> 00:37:55,515
Okay, okay, okay. The thing is...

455
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:59,486
...we're trying to make this sound
more real than it normally would.

456
00:37:59,824 --> 00:38:02,349
Problem is it sounds kind of not real.

457
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,721
-So we'll see you later.
-No.

458
00:38:04,929 --> 00:38:09,025
All right. l'll show you.
But if things get out of hand...

459
00:38:09,234 --> 00:38:11,065
We'll aim for Bigfoot.

460
00:38:12,003 --> 00:38:13,265
That's loaded.

461
00:38:21,579 --> 00:38:23,046
He's hopping.

462
00:38:29,554 --> 00:38:31,021
Smart house.

463
00:38:33,291 --> 00:38:34,451
Hey.

464
00:38:34,659 --> 00:38:37,526
You-- Both of you. Come here.

465
00:38:37,729 --> 00:38:38,923
Bring it to the car.

466
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:40,392
Come on.

467
00:38:40,598 --> 00:38:44,034
l'm gonna forget you throwing that rock
because that dance was pretty funny.

468
00:38:44,235 --> 00:38:46,635
But next time any of you
mess with this guy's house...

469
00:38:46,838 --> 00:38:49,272
...all three of you are going
in the hole, you got it?

470
00:38:49,474 --> 00:38:51,203
Now, l'll give you
10 seconds to march.

471
00:38:51,409 --> 00:38:52,774
But we need your help.

472
00:38:52,977 --> 00:38:54,968
lt's your job to help us.

473
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:56,613
-One.
-Come on.

474
00:38:56,815 --> 00:38:58,339
Two.

475
00:38:58,550 --> 00:38:59,710
Three.

476
00:38:59,918 --> 00:39:00,976
Four.

477
00:39:01,186 --> 00:39:02,619
Five.

478
00:39:03,388 --> 00:39:04,446
That's tender.

479
00:39:04,656 --> 00:39:06,749
My house is right over there.

480
00:39:08,526 --> 00:39:10,687
So much for relying
on the government.

481
00:39:10,895 --> 00:39:12,556
Yeah, l know.
l hate the government.

482
00:39:12,764 --> 00:39:15,198
-Dude, we're screwed.
-No, we're not.

483
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,834
We'll go to an expert.

484
00:39:19,971 --> 00:39:22,565
You're looking
at the three-time, tri-state...

485
00:39:22,774 --> 00:39:26,141
...over-14
''Thou Art Dead'' champion.

486
00:39:26,344 --> 00:39:29,780
His name is Reginald Skulinski.
But they call him Skull.

487
00:39:29,981 --> 00:39:31,949
-Who's ''they''?
-Me and DJ.

488
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:34,983
-Yeah.
-He's the smartest guy on earth.

489
00:39:35,353 --> 00:39:36,684
So let's go talk to him.

490
00:39:36,888 --> 00:39:39,413
-Hey, Jenny, Jenny.
-Hey, Jenny, Jenny, hold on. Hold up.

491
00:39:39,624 --> 00:39:41,592
Skull is in the game zone right now.

492
00:39:41,793 --> 00:39:44,284
You don't wanna mess with him
when he's in the game zone.

493
00:39:44,629 --> 00:39:47,598
Fine, so how long
is he gonna be playing?

494
00:39:47,799 --> 00:39:49,528
Die. Die.

495
00:39:50,635 --> 00:39:54,628
Who knows? He once played
for four days straight...

496
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:58,935
...on one quarter, a gallon
of chocolate milk and an adult diaper.

497
00:39:59,144 --> 00:40:00,975
The man's a legend.

498
00:40:01,179 --> 00:40:04,273
Well, if he's not coming out of
the game zone, then we are going in.

499
00:40:04,482 --> 00:40:06,814
-What? Hey, what are you--?
-What? Jenny, no.

500
00:40:09,387 --> 00:40:11,947
lt's like you're not gonna--
You're not gonna do it. Like--

501
00:40:12,157 --> 00:40:14,216
You're gonna die. You're gonna die.

502
00:40:14,426 --> 00:40:15,518
Watch out.

503
00:40:15,727 --> 00:40:18,025
Did you see that?
l just chopped off your head again.

504
00:40:18,229 --> 00:40:21,130
Your head's rolling. You can't see it,
your eyes are on your head.

505
00:40:21,332 --> 00:40:23,129
-Sir?
-What?

506
00:40:23,334 --> 00:40:26,929
l'm busy playing a video game
without even looking at the screen.

507
00:40:27,272 --> 00:40:28,762
What?

508
00:40:28,973 --> 00:40:30,873
Old man Nebbercracker's house
is possessed.

509
00:40:31,075 --> 00:40:33,635
l need to know how to destroy it
before it kills people.

510
00:40:33,845 --> 00:40:37,872
Calm down. You make me wanna
throw up in some tinfoil and eat it.

511
00:40:38,082 --> 00:40:40,676
Oh, you like the steel of my blade?
lt's so cold.

512
00:40:44,656 --> 00:40:47,056
Possessed house, you say?

513
00:40:49,394 --> 00:40:53,194
ln my travels to the video store
and comic-book conventions...

514
00:40:53,398 --> 00:40:56,162
...l've seen many strange
and wondrous things.

515
00:40:56,367 --> 00:40:58,927
And l've heard tell
of man-made structures...

516
00:40:59,137 --> 00:41:02,300
...becoming possessed
by a human soul...

517
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:06,101
...so that the spirit becomes merged
with wood and brick...

518
00:41:06,311 --> 00:41:09,405
...creating a rare form of monster...

519
00:41:09,614 --> 00:41:14,449
...known as Domus mactabilis.

520
00:41:18,156 --> 00:41:20,784
The house is Mr. Nebbercracker.

521
00:41:20,992 --> 00:41:22,516
We're its murderous enemies.

522
00:41:23,962 --> 00:41:25,896
Have fun getting killed.

523
00:41:26,097 --> 00:41:28,190
Run, coward.

524
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,628
Look at that blood.

525
00:41:32,036 --> 00:41:34,596
So how do we kill it?

526
00:41:34,806 --> 00:41:38,298
You've gotta strike
at the source of life, the heart.

527
00:41:39,444 --> 00:41:40,706
But houses don't have hearts.

528
00:41:40,912 --> 00:41:42,504
Yes!

529
00:41:44,349 --> 00:41:45,611
Oh, yeah.

530
00:41:45,817 --> 00:41:48,547
Yeah. You might be right about that.

531
00:41:50,622 --> 00:41:54,456
Sorry, children, but l've got some very
important business to take care of.

532
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:58,124
l won't be seeing you later.

533
00:42:06,471 --> 00:42:08,439
Thou art dead.

534
00:42:17,749 --> 00:42:19,307
So we need to strike at the heart.

535
00:42:19,517 --> 00:42:23,180
Yeah, but where are we gonna find
a heart inside a house?

536
00:42:25,890 --> 00:42:27,755
Ever since Nebbercracker died...

537
00:42:27,959 --> 00:42:30,587
...there's been smoke
coming out of that chimney.

538
00:42:35,166 --> 00:42:37,760
The furnace.
The furnace is the heart.

539
00:42:38,903 --> 00:42:41,963
lf we wanna put out the fire,
we're gonna have to go inside.

540
00:42:42,173 --> 00:42:44,573
Without getting chewed to pieces.

541
00:42:46,711 --> 00:42:48,611
-Dummy.
-Hey, l was just doodling.

542
00:42:48,813 --> 00:42:51,475
No, Chowder, this is it.
First, we build a dummy.

543
00:42:51,683 --> 00:42:54,174
We fill the dummy
with a few gallons of cold medicine.

544
00:42:54,385 --> 00:42:56,910
-Borrow it from your dad's pharmacy.
-Say what?

545
00:42:57,121 --> 00:43:00,113
Feed the dummy to the house, house
eats the medicine, goes to sleep.

546
00:43:00,325 --> 00:43:03,294
-Look at this.
-We get in, douse the fire and get out.

547
00:43:07,231 --> 00:43:09,859
-Questions?
-Yes, are you nuts?

548
00:43:10,068 --> 00:43:11,933
l don't wanna steal drugs
from my father...

549
00:43:12,136 --> 00:43:14,730
...l don't wanna go inside a monster
and l don't wanna die.

550
00:43:14,939 --> 00:43:17,806
-l say it's worth a shot.
-Yes, l agree, let's do it.

551
00:43:48,106 --> 00:43:51,200
Hey, but l wanted that one.

552
00:43:51,409 --> 00:43:53,673
-You've gotta be kidding me.
-Yes.

553
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:25,973
-Chowder. Quiet.
-Sorry.

554
00:44:32,450 --> 00:44:33,849
Go.

555
00:44:42,894 --> 00:44:45,089
Whoopsie-daisy.

556
00:44:53,171 --> 00:44:57,437
All right, little vacuum-cleaner dummy,
l'm gonna move you into position.

557
00:44:58,609 --> 00:45:00,975
You don't be scared.

558
00:45:01,179 --> 00:45:03,044
That's not how l trained you.

559
00:45:03,247 --> 00:45:04,942
l love you, vacuum-cleaner dummy.

560
00:45:06,317 --> 00:45:07,944
Chowder, come on.

561
00:45:16,127 --> 00:45:17,617
Okay.

562
00:45:26,804 --> 00:45:28,328
Yes.

563
00:45:30,541 --> 00:45:32,532
Trick or treat.

564
00:45:33,845 --> 00:45:35,039
Plug it in.

565
00:46:19,590 --> 00:46:21,490
So close.

566
00:46:26,063 --> 00:46:29,658
Littering, loitering,
vandalism, vagrancy--

567
00:46:29,867 --> 00:46:31,494
-And treason.
-No, not treason.

568
00:46:31,702 --> 00:46:33,567
-You sure? Because in the book--
-l'm sure.

569
00:46:33,771 --> 00:46:35,932
All right, kids, out of the trash cans.
Let's go.

570
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:40,008
Come on. You heard the big guy.
You see the light. Walk towards it.

571
00:46:40,978 --> 00:46:42,036
Come on, keep it moving.

572
00:46:42,246 --> 00:46:45,044
All right, drop your weapons.

573
00:46:45,249 --> 00:46:47,581
Pass them to me. Come on.

574
00:46:49,487 --> 00:46:54,151
-l will shoot you.
-Well, lookie we got here.

575
00:46:57,495 --> 00:46:59,588
You stay here,
l'm checking this out.

576
00:47:00,364 --> 00:47:03,390
l am on it.

577
00:47:17,748 --> 00:47:21,275
Y'all think something's funny?
You testing me? Huh, tough girl?

578
00:47:21,485 --> 00:47:22,747
You disrespecting the badge?

579
00:47:22,954 --> 00:47:26,287
You don't want none of this.
l'm telling you. Test me. Please.

580
00:47:26,490 --> 00:47:28,651
Y'all wanna test me?

581
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:30,384
l am the police.

582
00:47:32,296 --> 00:47:34,787
l know you're a thug.
Them brown eyes...

583
00:47:34,999 --> 00:47:36,125
l see it in your eyes.

584
00:47:36,334 --> 00:47:38,802
That's it. That is it.

585
00:47:39,003 --> 00:47:41,437
You got something to say,
Porky, huh?

586
00:47:41,639 --> 00:47:44,904
-That's it, we're taking them in.
-That's what l'm talking about.

587
00:47:45,109 --> 00:47:47,270
-Where we taking them?
-To jail. Let's go.

588
00:47:47,478 --> 00:47:50,845
You hear that?
You guys are going to jail.

589
00:47:51,048 --> 00:47:53,039
But, officer,
you've gotta believe us.

590
00:47:53,251 --> 00:47:55,412
Yeah, 2-percent,
you got the right to shut up.

591
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:59,021
-Okay, the house is a monster.
-And to think l believed you.

592
00:47:59,223 --> 00:48:02,920
Hey, listen, l'm with you guys.
My cousin's a cop in Milwaukee.

593
00:48:03,127 --> 00:48:05,755
l mean, kind of a cop.
He has a gun.

594
00:48:05,963 --> 00:48:08,864
Yeah. They're gonna love you
downtown, Jughead.

595
00:48:11,769 --> 00:48:13,464
We are supercops.

596
00:48:13,671 --> 00:48:15,935
Yeah. That's why l live in a condo.

597
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:18,665
Supercop. Super-duper-duper-cop.
Super--

598
00:48:20,478 --> 00:48:23,072
-You hear that?
-That's my stomach. l'm starving.

599
00:48:23,281 --> 00:48:26,944
No, no. That sounds
like the dangerous creature.

600
00:48:27,151 --> 00:48:30,450
-l'm gonna go check it out.
-Oh, my gosh.

601
00:48:30,655 --> 00:48:33,886
This is like trying to wrangle a puppy.
All right, l'll be back.

602
00:48:34,091 --> 00:48:35,353
-You guys, stop.
-Hey, guys.

603
00:48:35,559 --> 00:48:38,187
-No. Get out of there.
-No, don't go in there.

604
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:50,772
What?

605
00:48:53,177 --> 00:48:56,635
l tell you. Super-roll.

606
00:48:58,215 --> 00:49:00,809
-Stop. Stop.
-Hey. Hey. Come on.

607
00:49:01,018 --> 00:49:02,849
You don't know
what's up with that house.

608
00:49:07,091 --> 00:49:09,924
Where you at, spooky creature?

609
00:49:10,127 --> 00:49:11,856
l'm gonna find you.

610
00:49:16,867 --> 00:49:17,891
Freeze...

611
00:49:18,135 --> 00:49:19,727
...tree.

612
00:49:21,939 --> 00:49:24,373
Hey, what you doing?
You can't do that.

613
00:49:24,575 --> 00:49:28,204
Not to an officer, brother.
That is illegal.

614
00:49:30,281 --> 00:49:33,216
-l'm coming, buddy.
-Put me down!

615
00:49:33,417 --> 00:49:36,909
-l'm gonna go get backup.
-l thought there was no backup.

616
00:49:37,121 --> 00:49:38,588
l'm getting Judy.

617
00:49:40,925 --> 00:49:43,553
Judy!

618
00:49:44,228 --> 00:49:46,253
Help!

619
00:49:46,464 --> 00:49:47,863
Mama!

620
00:49:52,103 --> 00:49:54,663
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God.

621
00:49:54,872 --> 00:49:58,103
-l think l'm having a stroke.
-Just try to stay calm, okay?

622
00:49:58,309 --> 00:50:01,107
We'll be all right
if we just stay calm.

623
00:50:14,025 --> 00:50:16,050
l'm too young to die!

624
00:50:25,169 --> 00:50:28,070
Jenny. l've always loved you.

625
00:50:29,173 --> 00:50:31,141
-Chowder!
-Sorry.

626
00:50:31,542 --> 00:50:33,407
Mama!

627
00:50:33,878 --> 00:50:35,846
l can't look.

628
00:50:42,153 --> 00:50:44,553
Guys, come on. Let's go.

629
00:51:26,430 --> 00:51:30,264
We're dead. You've killed us
and now we're dead.

630
00:51:30,468 --> 00:51:33,437
l don't think the house knows
that we're in here.

631
00:51:33,637 --> 00:51:36,128
l bet it thinks we're still in the car.

632
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:37,830
Listen.

633
00:51:38,042 --> 00:51:40,272
lt sounds like it's sleeping.

634
00:51:40,644 --> 00:51:43,169
The only way that we're gonna
get out of here alive...

635
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:45,940
...is if we find the heart,
we put out the fire.

636
00:51:46,150 --> 00:51:48,482
Maybe we should examine
our other options.

637
00:51:48,686 --> 00:51:50,711
Sure. Other option.

638
00:51:50,921 --> 00:51:54,220
We wait here and do nothing
until it wakes up and eats us.

639
00:51:55,192 --> 00:51:58,320
Find the heart,
put out the fire. Got it.

640
00:52:09,874 --> 00:52:13,037
Explosives. That's so cool.

641
00:52:30,895 --> 00:52:33,420
-He was watching me.
-DJ.

642
00:52:35,266 --> 00:52:36,790
Did you ever see a wife?

643
00:52:37,835 --> 00:52:40,303
People used to say he had one...

644
00:52:41,405 --> 00:52:43,839
...but he fattened her up...

645
00:52:44,375 --> 00:52:46,343
...and he ate her.

646
00:52:53,184 --> 00:52:55,982
''Demolition squad.''

647
00:53:00,157 --> 00:53:01,988
Sorry.

648
00:53:02,393 --> 00:53:03,917
Come on.

649
00:53:07,398 --> 00:53:08,592
Be quiet.

650
00:53:08,799 --> 00:53:11,529
Don't worry, l have a very light step.

651
00:53:20,044 --> 00:53:21,443
There. Right there. Shoot it.

652
00:54:02,286 --> 00:54:04,151
What? l thought
if l shot the heart, that--

653
00:54:04,355 --> 00:54:06,550
-That's not the heart.
-Then what is it?

654
00:54:06,757 --> 00:54:10,887
Well, if those are the teeth
and that's the tongue...

655
00:54:11,095 --> 00:54:13,393
...then that must be the uvula.

656
00:54:16,634 --> 00:54:18,693
So it's a girl house.

657
00:54:18,902 --> 00:54:20,836
What? No.

658
00:54:21,038 --> 00:54:24,599
lt stimulates the gag reflex.
Everyone has a uvula.

659
00:54:24,808 --> 00:54:26,002
Not me.

660
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:44,518
No.

661
00:54:48,832 --> 00:54:51,528
Okay. Let's move.

662
00:54:56,807 --> 00:54:59,275
We need to move quickly
and quietly.

663
00:54:59,476 --> 00:55:00,909
Don't touch anything.

664
00:55:01,111 --> 00:55:03,477
And stay together--

665
00:55:03,681 --> 00:55:05,546
-DJ!
-Wait.

666
00:55:05,749 --> 00:55:07,307
DJ.

667
00:55:12,589 --> 00:55:14,682
l'll save you.

668
00:55:28,472 --> 00:55:30,337
Chowder, knock it off.

669
00:55:30,541 --> 00:55:33,635
Sorry. l thought you were-- DJ!

670
00:55:33,844 --> 00:55:36,210
-Chowder, it's a toy.
-Oh, yeah.

671
00:55:36,413 --> 00:55:38,347
Where's DJ?

672
00:55:38,549 --> 00:55:41,416
-DJ.
-Over here.

673
00:55:44,888 --> 00:55:47,413
Look at all these toys.

674
00:55:49,059 --> 00:55:52,392
This must be where
Nebbercracker kept his stash.

675
00:55:53,230 --> 00:55:54,993
''Stash.''

676
00:55:56,333 --> 00:55:58,563
l think you guys
should have a look at this.

677
00:56:17,721 --> 00:56:20,383
-The key.
-Come on, we don't have time for this.

678
00:56:20,591 --> 00:56:22,354
Yeah, we've gotta
find a way out of here.

679
00:56:29,933 --> 00:56:31,924
What are you doing?

680
00:56:41,145 --> 00:56:44,342
We have a Ping-Pong table
in our basement.

681
00:56:50,287 --> 00:56:51,447
Constance.

682
00:56:51,655 --> 00:56:55,182
Holy moly. He really did eat her.

683
00:56:55,392 --> 00:56:57,121
Couldn't have.

684
00:56:57,327 --> 00:57:01,161
Her whole body is buried in cement.

685
00:57:08,806 --> 00:57:10,899
Look at all this stuff.

686
00:57:12,142 --> 00:57:15,942
Why would he build her a shrine
if he murdered her?

687
00:57:16,146 --> 00:57:20,742
Maybe he just felt guilty or something.
DJ, can we please get out of here?

688
00:57:24,087 --> 00:57:28,023
l always knew you were hiding
something, Mr. Nebbercracker.

689
00:57:31,562 --> 00:57:33,325
DJ.

690
00:57:35,966 --> 00:57:38,264
Way to go, big nose.

691
00:57:49,313 --> 00:57:51,975
-lt's awake.
-Run!

692
00:57:59,389 --> 00:58:00,583
Hide.

693
00:58:20,277 --> 00:58:23,474
Hey, l know that sound.

694
00:58:27,084 --> 00:58:28,984
My ball.

695
00:58:29,186 --> 00:58:32,121
Where are you going? Come here.

696
00:58:32,322 --> 00:58:36,019
-Chowder, come back.
-You get back here.

697
00:58:38,562 --> 00:58:39,756
Gotcha.

698
00:58:43,133 --> 00:58:45,328
Killer Slinkys!

699
00:58:46,870 --> 00:58:50,067
-Chowder.
-Leave me alone!

700
00:58:58,849 --> 00:59:02,307
DJ! Help!

701
00:59:05,255 --> 00:59:06,745
Oh, no.

702
00:59:14,131 --> 00:59:15,120
Get off.

703
00:59:27,978 --> 00:59:29,536
Jenny.

704
00:59:30,113 --> 00:59:31,137
Chowder.

705
00:59:35,118 --> 00:59:37,348
Come on, Chowder, grab on.

706
00:59:38,655 --> 00:59:40,213
Gotcha.

707
00:59:42,059 --> 00:59:43,617
DJ, look out!

708
00:59:48,398 --> 00:59:49,865
No!

709
00:59:50,567 --> 00:59:52,728
The uvula.

710
01:00:09,419 --> 01:00:12,115
-DJ--
-Chowder.

711
01:00:12,422 --> 01:00:14,322
Mommy!

712
01:00:28,605 --> 01:00:30,334
Gross.

713
01:00:31,108 --> 01:00:32,598
Did we just get upchucked?

714
01:00:32,809 --> 01:00:36,006
The uvula, nature's emergency exit.

715
01:00:39,716 --> 01:00:43,675
That's it. Another great idea, DJ.
Brilliant.

716
01:00:43,887 --> 01:00:45,320
What do you want from me,
Chowder?

717
01:00:45,522 --> 01:00:47,854
l don't see you coming up
with any big ideas.

718
01:00:48,058 --> 01:00:50,549
Oh, yeah? Yeah?
Do you wanna hear my big idea?

719
01:00:50,761 --> 01:00:54,595
l'm going home to make
a pretzel sandwich. See you.

720
01:00:54,998 --> 01:00:57,762
Chowder, the house is still alive
and you're gonna wuss out?

721
01:00:57,968 --> 01:01:00,766
l risked my life for you.
l stole drugs for you...

722
01:01:00,971 --> 01:01:03,166
...and l could've died in there.
-Yeah, me too.

723
01:01:03,373 --> 01:01:06,001
You're the one that killed
Nebbercracker in the first place.

724
01:01:06,209 --> 01:01:07,767
-Getting your ball back.
-You guys.

725
01:01:07,978 --> 01:01:10,572
Stop fighting.
You're acting like babies.

726
01:01:10,781 --> 01:01:12,806
We are babies.

727
01:01:13,016 --> 01:01:14,415
What were we thinking?

728
01:01:14,618 --> 01:01:17,519
We tried to put a house to sleep
with cold medicine.

729
01:01:17,721 --> 01:01:20,656
-How lame can you get?
-Where are you going?

730
01:01:20,857 --> 01:01:23,655
l'm going home. l suck.

731
01:01:26,463 --> 01:01:28,260
DJ.

732
01:01:28,999 --> 01:01:31,832
At least it's an ambulance.

733
01:01:34,905 --> 01:01:36,600
DJ?

734
01:01:55,292 --> 01:01:57,283
lt's a ghost.

735
01:01:58,462 --> 01:02:00,453
Begone. Fie.

736
01:02:00,664 --> 01:02:04,430
Begone yourself. Get away.

737
01:02:05,635 --> 01:02:07,296
He's not a ghost.

738
01:02:07,504 --> 01:02:10,268
He's not dead. l'm not a murderer.

739
01:02:10,741 --> 01:02:14,233
Of course l'm not dead.
Who said l was dead?

740
01:02:15,145 --> 01:02:17,045
You'll be dead if you don't scram.

741
01:02:17,247 --> 01:02:19,078
-Come on, DJ.
-Let's hurry.

742
01:02:19,282 --> 01:02:22,683
Don't you know what day this is?

743
01:02:25,222 --> 01:02:28,385
l'm running out of time.
l'm running out of time.

744
01:02:32,462 --> 01:02:34,054
Honey...

745
01:02:35,432 --> 01:02:36,956
...l'm home.

746
01:02:41,271 --> 01:02:42,898
Oh, look at you, dear.

747
01:02:44,107 --> 01:02:46,371
Your shingles are all ruffled...

748
01:02:47,310 --> 01:02:49,835
...and your windows are cracked.

749
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:56,283
Oh, but it's no problem, sweetheart.
lt's no problem at all.

750
01:02:56,486 --> 01:02:59,546
lt's her. The house is her.

751
01:02:59,756 --> 01:03:01,519
-DJ, what are you doing?
-Wait. Come on.

752
01:03:01,725 --> 01:03:03,056
-Come back.
-Where you going?

753
01:03:03,260 --> 01:03:04,989
Nothing paint and varnish
can't handle.

754
01:03:05,195 --> 01:03:07,527
Mr. Nebbercracker.

755
01:03:09,099 --> 01:03:10,430
l know about Constance.

756
01:03:10,634 --> 01:03:12,158
You what?

757
01:03:12,702 --> 01:03:15,102
What do you know?
You don't know anything.

758
01:03:20,510 --> 01:03:22,910
You were in my house? You--

759
01:03:27,050 --> 01:03:29,211
You didn't kill her, did you?

760
01:03:33,757 --> 01:03:36,521
l love her so much.

761
01:04:04,821 --> 01:04:06,345
Hello?

762
01:04:08,692 --> 01:04:10,455
lt's okay.

763
01:04:11,728 --> 01:04:13,992
l can take you away from here.

764
01:04:14,197 --> 01:04:15,994
Would you like that?

765
01:04:19,569 --> 01:04:21,127
Yes.

766
01:04:22,873 --> 01:04:24,773
There we go.

767
01:04:24,975 --> 01:04:26,772
Won't be long now.

768
01:04:34,150 --> 01:04:35,811
All right.

769
01:04:37,921 --> 01:04:39,912
Okay, open your eyes.

770
01:04:41,524 --> 01:04:44,857
-Now, it's not much, l know, but just--
-Darling.

771
01:04:50,901 --> 01:04:53,233
Get away from my house!

772
01:04:53,436 --> 01:04:56,530
l'm gonna rip them to bits.

773
01:04:57,807 --> 01:04:59,434
Help.

774
01:04:59,643 --> 01:05:01,110
-Constance.
-Help. Help.

775
01:05:01,311 --> 01:05:03,472
-What's wrong? Are you hurt?
-Hurt?

776
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:06,706
Yes, l'm hurt. Those criminals
are attacking our house.

777
01:05:06,917 --> 01:05:08,111
-Trick or treat.
-Now, now...

778
01:05:08,451 --> 01:05:11,318
...they're just kids, dear.

779
01:05:11,521 --> 01:05:12,715
-lt's Halloween.
-No, no, no.

780
01:05:12,923 --> 01:05:15,289
lt's my house,
and they're hurting me.

781
01:05:15,492 --> 01:05:18,655
Constance, look at me. Look at me.

782
01:05:18,862 --> 01:05:23,629
As long as l'm here,
l will never let anyone hurt you.

783
01:05:23,833 --> 01:05:25,027
-Constance.
-Sucker.

784
01:05:25,235 --> 01:05:26,862
You vandals.

785
01:05:27,070 --> 01:05:28,560
-Eat this.
-You hooligans.

786
01:05:28,772 --> 01:05:31,240
-l'll get you.
-Constance, no!

787
01:05:45,355 --> 01:05:48,722
So l finished the house.

788
01:05:48,925 --> 01:05:51,689
She would've wanted that.

789
01:05:52,362 --> 01:05:56,389
She died, but she didn't leave.

790
01:06:00,437 --> 01:06:02,371
And that night...

791
01:06:02,572 --> 01:06:07,202
...that one night of every year...

792
01:06:07,410 --> 01:06:09,605
...l had to take precautions.

793
01:06:09,813 --> 01:06:11,576
-Trick or treat.
-l had to.

794
01:06:11,781 --> 01:06:15,273
-Sucker.
-l had to.

795
01:06:18,154 --> 01:06:20,850
Hey! Get a--

796
01:06:21,057 --> 01:06:24,652
Stay away from my house!

797
01:06:25,562 --> 01:06:28,622
She attacks anyone
who comes near.

798
01:06:28,832 --> 01:06:30,026
Go.

799
01:06:30,233 --> 01:06:32,793
l'm coming, dear.

800
01:06:33,003 --> 01:06:34,493
Go.

801
01:06:35,205 --> 01:06:37,901
No, no, no, wait. l can't let you
do this, Mr. Nebbercracker.

802
01:06:38,108 --> 01:06:40,633
l know that you've been
protecting us all these years.

803
01:06:40,844 --> 01:06:42,869
But now it's our turn to protect you.

804
01:06:43,079 --> 01:06:45,138
Let her go.

805
01:06:49,652 --> 01:06:51,449
But if l let her go...

806
01:06:52,155 --> 01:06:53,588
...then l'll have no one.

807
01:06:54,457 --> 01:06:56,084
That's not true.

808
01:07:09,406 --> 01:07:10,930
Constance, no!

809
01:07:20,316 --> 01:07:21,578
Come on.

810
01:07:22,318 --> 01:07:25,776
The house is alive!

811
01:07:33,530 --> 01:07:35,828
This way. This way. Come on.

812
01:07:36,466 --> 01:07:38,331
You guys, come on.

813
01:07:43,606 --> 01:07:45,938
-What are you doing?
-Trying to slow the house down.

814
01:07:46,142 --> 01:07:48,303
Move it, pork chop.

815
01:07:51,748 --> 01:07:53,375
Come on, come on.

816
01:08:08,331 --> 01:08:10,731
Come on, Mr. Nebbercracker.
Come on.

817
01:08:12,569 --> 01:08:14,764
l can't.

818
01:08:17,407 --> 01:08:19,375
Mr. Nebbercracker. Hurry.

819
01:08:19,709 --> 01:08:21,574
Go on. l'll be all right.

820
01:08:22,612 --> 01:08:24,239
Oh, man.

821
01:08:37,060 --> 01:08:39,722
What are you waiting for?
Come on.

822
01:09:03,887 --> 01:09:07,254
You stay away
from those children, Constance!

823
01:09:33,216 --> 01:09:34,410
Constance.

824
01:09:35,818 --> 01:09:37,376
Mr. Nebbercracker.

825
01:09:39,656 --> 01:09:41,283
Oh, now...

826
01:09:42,825 --> 01:09:45,385
There, there, girl.

827
01:09:47,530 --> 01:09:49,464
My sweet.

828
01:09:50,567 --> 01:09:53,092
You've been a bad girl, haven't you?

829
01:09:53,970 --> 01:09:56,200
You've hurt people.

830
01:09:56,539 --> 01:09:58,803
Oh, Constance.

831
01:09:59,542 --> 01:10:04,343
Oh, we've always known
this day would come. Haven't we?

832
01:10:10,019 --> 01:10:12,886
l have to make things right.

833
01:10:15,959 --> 01:10:19,053
l have to make things right.

834
01:10:22,031 --> 01:10:23,794
Constance.

835
01:10:27,170 --> 01:10:30,662
l've always done
what's best for you, haven't l?

836
01:10:32,275 --> 01:10:33,537
Haven't l, girl?

837
01:10:36,646 --> 01:10:38,238
Come on, let's move.

838
01:10:39,315 --> 01:10:41,374
Oh, Constance.

839
01:10:44,754 --> 01:10:48,190
Let this be the right thing to do.

840
01:10:54,864 --> 01:10:56,058
Leave him alone!

841
01:10:56,266 --> 01:10:59,633
Yeah, get your grubby branches
off the old man!

842
01:11:01,504 --> 01:11:03,165
Take that!

843
01:11:04,407 --> 01:11:06,398
And that!

844
01:11:08,611 --> 01:11:10,841
Mr. Nebbercracker.

845
01:11:12,915 --> 01:11:14,746
Oh, kid, come here.

846
01:11:16,386 --> 01:11:18,320
-Take this.
-What?

847
01:11:18,955 --> 01:11:20,855
You have to help me. Please.

848
01:11:21,057 --> 01:11:23,321
l know you can do it.

849
01:11:25,528 --> 01:11:28,725
Go on. Go. Hurry.

850
01:11:30,466 --> 01:11:32,229
How do you know
how to drive this thing?

851
01:11:32,435 --> 01:11:33,993
l don't.

852
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:40,502
The chimney.
The chimney leads to the heart.

853
01:11:46,749 --> 01:11:48,216
Jenny!

854
01:12:00,229 --> 01:12:02,754
Jenny. Are you all right?

855
01:12:03,199 --> 01:12:05,064
l'm not sure.

856
01:12:09,072 --> 01:12:11,700
DJ, get rid of that thing.

857
01:12:11,908 --> 01:12:13,933
l'm working on it.

858
01:12:14,143 --> 01:12:17,044
Chowder, l need you to get the house
down under that crane.

859
01:12:17,347 --> 01:12:18,837
Think you could do that?

860
01:12:19,048 --> 01:12:20,948
Piece of cake.

861
01:12:22,318 --> 01:12:23,785
Come on.

862
01:12:29,792 --> 01:12:32,920
You think you can just
mess with my friends?

863
01:12:39,435 --> 01:12:41,198
DJ, look.

864
01:12:56,319 --> 01:12:58,116
Mommy.

865
01:13:04,093 --> 01:13:05,492
Chowder.

866
01:13:05,695 --> 01:13:07,754
Come in, Chowder.

867
01:13:07,964 --> 01:13:10,091
Chowder, buddy?

868
01:13:18,841 --> 01:13:20,069
Hey, guys.

869
01:13:20,276 --> 01:13:23,871
Look who just won.
lt's me, the screwup.

870
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:26,810
Way to go, Chowder, you did it!

871
01:13:27,517 --> 01:13:30,748
Look at me. Look at Chowder.
Oh, yeah.

872
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:33,550
-Sorry.
-Guys, come on.

873
01:13:34,657 --> 01:13:37,125
Yes. Look at me.

874
01:13:41,764 --> 01:13:43,391
You can't do that.

875
01:13:43,599 --> 01:13:45,999
That's not fair.

876
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:07,382
No. Get on the top. Help!

877
01:14:11,127 --> 01:14:13,561
That's it, Chowder.
Keep her coming.

878
01:14:18,568 --> 01:14:22,163
You ain't nothing. You're a shack.
You're an outhouse.

879
01:14:28,611 --> 01:14:30,238
No!

880
01:15:18,127 --> 01:15:21,255
-l can't.
-Yes, you can.

881
01:15:23,799 --> 01:15:24,993
Go.

882
01:15:25,201 --> 01:15:26,793
l kissed a girl.

883
01:15:27,270 --> 01:15:29,101
l kissed a girl on the lips.

884
01:15:32,074 --> 01:15:35,976
Guys. Any time now.

885
01:15:41,150 --> 01:15:42,811
Sorry.

886
01:15:44,887 --> 01:15:47,219
DJ, hurry.

887
01:15:54,530 --> 01:15:56,088
l'm flying!

888
01:15:56,966 --> 01:16:00,629
-On three, light the dynamite.
-Okay, l got it.

889
01:16:04,874 --> 01:16:06,671
-One.
-Come on, come on, come on.

890
01:16:06,876 --> 01:16:09,310
-Two.
-Yes.

891
01:16:09,645 --> 01:16:11,203
Thr--

892
01:16:12,048 --> 01:16:14,482
DJ!

893
01:16:20,590 --> 01:16:22,524
Three!

894
01:17:21,050 --> 01:17:22,984
Do you guys hear something?

895
01:17:25,321 --> 01:17:27,915
lt's over there. Come on.

896
01:17:30,192 --> 01:17:32,353
Oh, my dear.

897
01:17:44,907 --> 01:17:46,807
Goodbye.

898
01:18:05,428 --> 01:18:09,922
l'm sorry, Mr. Nebbercracker,
about your house...

899
01:18:10,332 --> 01:18:13,699
...and your wife.

900
01:18:16,338 --> 01:18:17,737
Your house-wife.

901
01:18:21,644 --> 01:18:25,136
Forty-five years.

902
01:18:26,482 --> 01:18:31,749
We have been trapped
for 45 years.

903
01:18:31,954 --> 01:18:33,717
And now...

904
01:18:36,726 --> 01:18:38,717
...we're free.

905
01:18:41,564 --> 01:18:43,862
We're free.

906
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:46,600
Thank you, friend.

907
01:18:48,571 --> 01:18:50,971
Thank you all.

908
01:18:51,373 --> 01:18:53,466
We're free.

909
01:19:06,789 --> 01:19:07,983
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

910
01:19:08,190 --> 01:19:10,215
Happy Halloween.

911
01:19:11,727 --> 01:19:13,922
-Trick or treat.
-Trick or treat.

912
01:19:14,396 --> 01:19:15,420
Here you go.

913
01:19:15,664 --> 01:19:16,858
-Thanks.
-Thanks.

914
01:19:17,366 --> 01:19:19,095
Happy Halloween.

915
01:19:19,301 --> 01:19:20,893
Next.

916
01:19:23,105 --> 01:19:25,073
What happened
to Nebbercracker's house?

917
01:19:27,009 --> 01:19:29,807
lt turned into a monster,
so l blew it up.

918
01:19:31,647 --> 01:19:33,342
Trick or treat.

919
01:19:33,549 --> 01:19:34,880
We're gonna need a tricycle.

920
01:19:35,918 --> 01:19:38,386
One tricycle, coming up.

921
01:19:39,221 --> 01:19:41,155
Tricycle.

922
01:19:41,357 --> 01:19:43,257
Tricycle.

923
01:19:43,726 --> 01:19:45,853
-Tricycle.
-Hello, tricycle.

924
01:19:46,061 --> 01:19:47,926
l missed you so much.

925
01:19:48,130 --> 01:19:50,064
-Thank you, mister.
-Goodbye, now.

926
01:19:50,266 --> 01:19:52,826
-Happy Halloween.
-Come on.

927
01:19:53,536 --> 01:19:56,130
-Mom. There's my mom.
-Jenny!

928
01:19:56,338 --> 01:19:57,669
-One second.
-Okay.

929
01:19:59,008 --> 01:20:01,033
So...

930
01:20:01,243 --> 01:20:03,211
We should hang out again.

931
01:20:03,579 --> 01:20:04,671
Soon.

932
01:20:06,415 --> 01:20:08,474
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

933
01:20:08,684 --> 01:20:10,242
See you.

934
01:20:14,824 --> 01:20:17,190
Good luck with the puberty.

935
01:20:18,227 --> 01:20:20,661
She grabbed my butt.

936
01:20:20,863 --> 01:20:22,558
That's nice, Chowder.

937
01:20:22,765 --> 01:20:25,233
Hey, Mr. Nebbercracker.
lt's time to go.

938
01:20:25,434 --> 01:20:29,427
Oh, you go on.
l've got some work to do.

939
01:20:30,439 --> 01:20:32,566
All right. Thanks.

940
01:20:32,775 --> 01:20:34,606
-l'll see you around.
-All right. Bye.

941
01:20:34,810 --> 01:20:36,004
Hey.

942
01:20:36,512 --> 01:20:38,673
Stay off my lawn.

943
01:20:39,715 --> 01:20:41,615
l'm just kidding.

944
01:20:41,817 --> 01:20:44,718
-You think he'll be okay?
-Yeah. He'll be fine.

945
01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:48,287
He'll go on vacation, get some color,
maybe he'll meet someone new.

946
01:20:48,490 --> 01:20:50,720
This time, maybe
a nice beach house.

947
01:20:52,528 --> 01:20:53,722
Hey, DJ, look who's here.

948
01:20:53,929 --> 01:20:56,090
-Yes, l can see that, thank you.
-No biggie.

949
01:20:56,298 --> 01:20:58,061
-Hey, boys.
-Hey, Dad.

950
01:21:01,437 --> 01:21:04,201
What the heck kind--?
No, don't tell me. Let me guess.

951
01:21:04,874 --> 01:21:06,637
lt's...

952
01:21:08,477 --> 01:21:12,243
-Dirty pirates?
-That's it. Dirty pirates.

953
01:21:13,649 --> 01:21:16,243
Fun, fun. Oh, you look adorable.

954
01:21:16,919 --> 01:21:19,080
Have fun tonight.

955
01:21:33,636 --> 01:21:37,436
You know, you were right.

956
01:21:37,873 --> 01:21:40,501
We're definitely too old
for trick-or-treating.

957
01:21:40,709 --> 01:21:44,372
Oh, yeah. No question about it.

958
01:21:47,349 --> 01:21:49,078
On the other hand...

959
01:21:50,386 --> 01:21:52,411
...we've been working all night.

960
01:22:01,230 --> 01:22:02,561
Candy time?

961
01:22:03,198 --> 01:22:04,426
Candy time.

962
01:22:04,633 --> 01:22:06,828
We're back. Yes.

963
01:22:07,036 --> 01:22:09,004
Candy.

964
01:23:46,235 --> 01:23:49,568
-Did we just get--?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

965
01:23:50,939 --> 01:23:53,100
lt's Halloween, right?

966
01:23:53,308 --> 01:23:57,870
What do you say you and l go out...

967
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:01,777
...and ''inspect'' some candy, huh?

968
01:24:03,852 --> 01:24:06,980
We should go eat some candy too.

969
01:24:07,389 --> 01:24:08,617
That's a good idea.

970
01:24:08,824 --> 01:24:13,261
Okay. All right.
Let's go eat some candy.

971
01:24:13,462 --> 01:24:16,226
Lots of yummy candy.

972
01:24:16,432 --> 01:24:18,400
Like carrots.

973
01:24:19,568 --> 01:24:21,365
All right, where's the car?

974
01:24:21,570 --> 01:24:24,539
And that is how l slayed
that mystical dragon.

975
01:24:24,740 --> 01:24:27,766
Oh, yeah? That's great.

976
01:24:27,976 --> 01:24:29,466
Come on, baby. We're out of here.

977
01:24:30,946 --> 01:24:33,437
Not so fast, Bones.

978
01:24:33,649 --> 01:24:35,810
Times have changed.

979
01:24:36,018 --> 01:24:37,747
Skull's not like you.

980
01:24:37,953 --> 01:24:40,148
He gives me the respect l deserve...

981
01:24:40,355 --> 01:24:41,913
...and makes time for me.

982
01:24:42,691 --> 01:24:43,658
Whatever.

983
01:24:46,295 --> 01:24:47,319
Bones!

984
01:29:57,739 --> 01:29:59,331
Hello, fence.

985
01:30:08,950 --> 01:30:10,679
Hello, leaves.

986
01:30:15,157 --> 01:30:17,125
Hello, sky.
