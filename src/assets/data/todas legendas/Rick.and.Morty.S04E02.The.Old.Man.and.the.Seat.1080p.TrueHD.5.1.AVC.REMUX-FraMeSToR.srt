1
00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:06,088
We're out of syrup.

2
00:00:06,173 --> 00:00:07,299
Huh. You know what?

3
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:09,718
Maybe I'll use my intern.

4
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:12,137
- Glootie?
- Good?

5
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:13,931
- Thanks, Glootie.
- Anything else?

6
00:00:14,056 --> 00:00:15,349
Do you want to develop an app?

7
00:00:15,474 --> 00:00:17,160
- No thanks, Glootie.
- Hey, what's up, Glootie?

8
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:18,784
Hi, Morty.
Do you want to develop an app?

9
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,250
- No thanks.
- Rick, why does it say,

10
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:22,354
"Do not develop my app,"
on your intern's forehead?

11
00:00:22,397 --> 00:00:23,565
Why, you want to develop one?

12
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:24,959
Ah, I'm glad
you asked that, Jerry.

13
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:26,527
It's so you don't develop
his app.

14
00:00:26,652 --> 00:00:28,529
Glootie, go make some
photocopies of something.

15
00:00:28,654 --> 00:00:29,780
Cool.

16
00:00:29,905 --> 00:00:31,216
Well, if anyone wants
to develop an app with me,

17
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,282
I'm down.

18
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:34,868
He seems to <i>really</i> want
to develop an app.

19
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:37,013
He really does, sweetie,
but nobody's gonna do that.

20
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,455
Now, if you'll excuse me,

21
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,624
I've got a quick
solo adventure to go on,

22
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:43,293
and this one will not be
directed by Ron Howard.

23
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:44,294
He's gonna go POOP-

24
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:46,059
When Grandpa Rick pats
his belly like that

25
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:47,690
and leaves without Morty,
it means he's going to go poop.

26
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:49,634
He's a shy pooper.
He has a secret pooping place.

27
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:51,552
Man, fuck you, Summer.

28
00:00:51,677 --> 00:00:54,054
Honey, why can't you get
this excited about your SATs?

29
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:56,974
Well, I'm man enough to simply
say, "I'm going to poop,"

30
00:00:57,099 --> 00:00:59,643
and I'd be honored to have
Ron Howard involved.

31
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:00,852
Good job, hon.

32
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:02,578
- Way to go, Dad.
- We're rooting for ya.

33
00:01:06,525 --> 00:01:07,985
He's really putting you
to work, huh?

34
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:09,350
Did you want to develop an app?

35
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:11,613
<i>- I'll</i> pass, Glootie.
- Hmm, your loss.

36
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,323
Oh, yeah? Why's that?

37
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:14,884
Eh, it's an app
you'd want to develop.

38
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:17,286
- Can I ask what it is?
- Of course you can.

39
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:19,830
That's always the first step
in app development.

40
00:01:19,955 --> 00:01:23,458
Ah.

41
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:24,918
50/50! Final offer!

42
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:38,032
<i>II.</i>

43
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:25,038
Reverse digestion extrapolation.

44
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:26,790
Time to meet your maker.

45
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,417
[Cork pOpsl.

46
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:29,793
What are you guys doing?

47
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:31,253
Did you develop an app?

48
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:33,255
Rule number one
in app development, son...

49
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,923
Never follow the rules.

50
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:38,051
Except when the rule is tattooed
on an alien's forehead, Dad.

51
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:39,612
Why do you think
Rick would have that rule?

52
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,054
'Cause he's a disrupt-o-phobe.

53
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:42,514
No, Dad, no.

54
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,117
To keep something horrible
from happening,

55
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:46,059
something he's too lazy
to explain.

56
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:47,728
Guys, we're getting
our first users.

57
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:53,150
Whoa, this new app
just matched me

58
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:55,861
with a guy that is su my ty.

59
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:57,946
Super my type. Learn to abbre.

60
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,197
Hey!

61
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:01,950
Your su ty works
at Jersey Mike's

62
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,161
and sees 25 Phish shows a year.

63
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:06,580
- That is so Danny.
- Summer!

64
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:08,206
- Danny?
- Summer Smith?

65
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:10,792
Danny Publits from Lovefinderrz
with two "R's" and a "Z"?

66
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:13,295
I ran all the way here
while staring at your profile.

67
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,981
I tripped on a fire hydrant
and fell down,

68
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:16,923
so I'm covered in gravel
that stuck to my sweat.

69
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:18,467
And even after a shower,

70
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:20,469
I'll still be into a jam band
for old junkies,

71
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:22,679
but I think this world cares
too much about bands

72
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:24,973
and too little about love.

73
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,434
- And I think I love you.
- Me, too.

74
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:29,770
Hi, I'm my underaged
daughter's mother.

75
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:31,396
Nice to... whoa!

76
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:33,690
Come on. Just met.

77
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:35,233
Uh, this isn't working.

78
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:36,568
Wait. What are you...

79
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:37,861
Never mind.

80
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:40,822
I quit, I'm gay,
and I love Xander.

81
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,784
Stupid phones are destroying us.

82
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:45,410
Hey, sweetie.

83
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:47,579
<i>Honey, our daughter
ran off with a Frisbee golfer</i>

84
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:49,247
<i>because of some app
with a really dumb,</i>

85
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:50,874
<i>really forgettable name.</i>

86
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:54,628
<i>Like a really dumb, uncreative,
super sweaty name.</i>

87
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:55,980
<i>Anyway, I'll be late.
I love you.</i>

88
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:58,131
Got it. I love you, too.

89
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:00,634
Okay, Glootie,
take the app down.

90
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:03,261
Can't take it down.
I'm just an intern.

91
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:08,058
Uh, that's not how apps work.

92
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:09,810
Then make it how it works.

93
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:12,729
This isn't how
making things work works.

94
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:14,147
Get... get it off the server.

95
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:15,899
Y-You think we're stupid,
but we're not.

96
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,943
We know apps have something
to do with servers.

97
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:19,253
The server's on the mother ship.

98
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:20,278
Where's the mother ship?

99
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:21,738
- It's coming.
- Take us to it.

100
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:23,073
- No.
- Yes.

101
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:24,634
Shake him more, Morty.
That was working.

102
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:25,951
Take us to the mother ship.

103
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:40,382
Okay, don't hurt me.
Don't hurt me.

104
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:42,425
An ominous beeping app.

105
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:44,654
You can't stay made at a guy
with this kind of talent.

106
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,513
Dad, you can, and you have to.

107
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:54,604
- Ribbit, ribbit.
- Ribbit, ribbit.

108
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:56,582
- Hey, ribbit, ribbit, ribbit!
- Ribbit, ribbit, ribbit!

109
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:58,525
Look at this guy.
He wants to eat me so bad.

110
00:05:58,650 --> 00:05:59,860
You want to eat me, don't you?

111
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:01,736
- Ribbit.
- Just kidding. Have some drugs.

112
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:03,822
- Are you Vermigurber?
- What does this guy want?

113
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:05,842
- Who is this monkey?
- I'm here about a sandwich.

114
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:07,093
Oh, well you came
to the right place...

115
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:08,261
'cause you're about to get

116
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:09,536
a <i>bullet</i> sandwich

117
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:12,247
on two slices of whole... gun.

118
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,833
You might want to get that.

119
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:17,752
Hello?

120
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:19,754
<i>Dad, give the human
whatever he wants.</i>

121
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,798
<i>He knows where I live.
He's crazy!</i>

122
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:24,259
You fucking idiot.

123
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:27,345
I have 800,000 kids.

124
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,306
Don't forget your voicemail.

125
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:33,810
You have <i>470,000</i> messages.

126
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,353
Oh, ah, that's half of them.

127
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:37,238
Okay, w-w-what do you want?
What do you want?

128
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:40,400
Wait, this is seriously
about sandwiches?

129
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,777
I thought this was
about drugs or guns

130
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:44,922
or the fact that I'm a fly
that runs a frog restaurant.

131
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:47,240
There's a million things
that are interesting about me,

132
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:48,658
and none of them are sandwiches.

133
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:51,161
- Who ordered it?
- Talk to our delivery drone.

134
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:53,955
He... he run off to fight
in the robot wars.

135
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:57,167
Hey, ape man,
I hope this was worth

136
00:06:57,292 --> 00:06:59,085
making a whole swarm of enemies.

137
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:02,589
It will be when I find
whoever shit in my toilet.

138
00:07:02,714 --> 00:07:05,675
Is that code for something?
Someone look that up.

139
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,385
If that's drug slang,
I need to know it.

140
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,722
Ah!

141
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,642
- Mom, you can't stop true love.
- Oh, yes, I can.

142
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:15,119
- You're assaulting me!
- Keep your voice down.

143
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:16,436
I'm being assaulted!

144
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:17,812
Oh, yeah? Okay.

145
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:19,272
- Statutory rape!
- Whoa.

146
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:20,625
My daughter's about to be raped!

147
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:21,918
No, I'm not!
I'm being assaulted!

148
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:23,109
- Rape!
- Assault!

149
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:25,278
- Rape!
- Nobody cares. It's a motel.

150
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:27,131
Nobody's here because
their life's going so great

151
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:28,865
they can afford
to get mixed up in yours.

152
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,909
Deal with this shit on your own.

153
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:32,754
You can't stop us
from getting a motel room.

154
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:33,870
Fine. I'll get one, too.

155
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:35,622
I'm getting the one next door,

156
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:37,224
and I'm putting a glass
to the wall, and I'm listening.

157
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:39,250
- Fine. Enjoy.
- I will.

158
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:42,128
- I'm Danny, by the way.
- You had your chance, dick.

159
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:47,050
Take your app down.

160
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:48,176
T-Take... take it down.

161
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:49,678
- What?
- I'm their hostage.

162
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:51,739
- Do they have weapons?
- Nope, but neither do it.

163
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:52,931
Do... do you have a weapon?

164
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:54,724
No.

165
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:56,449
- Take the app down.
- Take the app down.

166
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,686
I can't. I'm an intern.

167
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:59,604
Okay, well who tells interns
what to do?

168
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:01,189
Not you, that's for sure.

169
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:05,193
Take us to whoever does,
or w-w-we'll... we'll punch you.

<i>9K8'!-</i>

171
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:08,029
Not bad, Morty.

172
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,924
Yeah, I don't know when
the other shoe's gonna drop,

173
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:12,117
but this is working
pretty good so far.

174
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:15,412
Greetings.
We are the Monogatrons.

175
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:17,789
While your species was
still toying with fire,

176
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:20,417
ours mastered the science
of functioning,

177
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:22,043
committed relationships.

178
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,004
As the latest planet
to develop our app,

179
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:28,633
you will now witness the true
power of superior intimacy.

180
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,260
Take the app down.

181
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:32,846
Take it down, or... we'll...
We'll... we'll punch you.

182
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:35,223
Is there someone
with a gun or...

183
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,349
It's on its way.

184
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:37,559
The app remains up.

185
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,144
So what's the evil plan?

186
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:41,104
Does there have to be
an evil plan?

187
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:43,481
- Oh, uh, uh...
- Uh, someone wanted a gun?

188
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:44,733
<i>I'll</i> take it. Thanks.

189
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:46,484
Here's the evil plan.

190
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:47,609
- Fuck!
- Goddamn it.

191
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:49,446
As a preapp civilization,

192
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:52,407
your love's value
is defined by scarcity.

193
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:55,368
You are highly trained
to seek it,

194
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:59,456
and you have no idea
how to maintain it.

195
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:01,624
Had you bothered to master love,

196
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:05,170
you would've learned by now,
it is as abundant as water.

197
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:07,505
You know what isn't? Water.

198
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,507
That shit runs out.

199
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:11,760
So we'll be taking yours.

200
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:14,679
While your planet continues
to dick around with a, uh...

201
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,556
What is their version
of it called?

202
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:18,767
Lovefinderrz,
with two "R's" and a.

203
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:20,602
- Oof.
- Yeah, not my idea.

204
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:22,687
- Goddamn.
- Am I interrupting?

205
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:26,232
- Impossible. Here she is.
- Mwah.

206
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:27,984
Your prisoners are getting away.

207
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,736
Prisoners are just things.

208
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:31,988
Connect with me.
Tell me about your day.

209
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:33,490
I had an incredible meeting.

210
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:35,909
Did you know humans
are 80% water?

211
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,513
And I found a new podcast
we can listen to tonight.

212
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:40,537
Loveit.

213
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,082
Okay, back to work.

214
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:44,667
Find and kill those earthlings.

215
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:52,133
We're outnumbered.
There's no hope.

216
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:55,428
Then we go out in glory.

217
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:57,222
Flesh intruder, prepare to die.

218
00:09:57,347 --> 00:09:59,140
Oh, hold on.

219
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:01,351
My apologies,
Lieutenant Commander.

220
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:03,353
No problem. At ease, Solider.

221
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:08,525
Initiate Employee
Evaluation Mode.

222
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:11,361
- Accessing delivery archive.
- Okay, listen.

223
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:13,321
You delivered an avian
protein club sandwich

224
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,490
with no lettu... Goddamn it.

225
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:23,615
<i>II.</i>

226
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:33,708
<i>II.</i>

227
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,971
Oy, scoping for this bit, then?

228
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,266
Alright, a-a-alright.
I know you want to have

229
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:42,976
the big guy/little guy fight,
but...

230
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:45,353
Aw, are you fucking kidding me?

231
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:49,649
Here at the <i>Midland</i> Quasar,

232
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:51,317
<i>where, in a complete upset,</i>

233
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:53,082
<i>the Robolution has overturned
the lizards.</i>

234
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:54,237
<i>It's totally unexpected.</i>

235
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:55,822
Uh, I understand, Mr. Phillips.

236
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:57,699
Yes.

237
00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:00,493
IbeHeve this is yours.

238
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:03,163
You, uh... you dropped that.

239
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:05,290
I'll have to call you back.

240
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:06,875
Where do you want to die?

241
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,335
Susan, is conference room three
available?

242
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:12,547
Can I look at a photo
of my wife while you kill me?

243
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,090
Sure, but I'm doing her a favor.

244
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:15,675
She either has terrible taste,

245
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,403
or she's trapped in a marriage
to a toilet thief.

246
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:19,220
She's dead.

247
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,055
And I don't mind joining her.

248
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:24,893
Life has been hollow
since I lost her.

249
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:27,228
Using your toilet
was nice, though.

250
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:30,440
I'm a bit of a shy pooper.

251
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:32,192
I'm ready when you are.

252
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:35,820
Stay there.

253
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:39,908
Tell him what you told me.

254
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:41,135
What is this? What's happening?

255
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:42,178
Tell him what you told me.

256
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:43,620
My wife's still alive.

257
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:45,665
Sh... sh... she went into remission
10 years ago.

258
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:46,745
And what did you do today?

259
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:48,124
Oh, I, uh, pooped

260
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:49,918
on a really awesome toilet
I found...

261
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:52,587
Oh, ow, ow, ow, ow, oh!

262
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,589
Don't use your dead wife
as an excuse.

263
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,217
You shit on my toilet because
you don't know your place,

264
00:11:57,342 --> 00:11:59,093
and your place is nothing.

265
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:00,762
So next time you stumble
onto a toilet

266
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:04,349
that feels too good
for your ass, trust me, it is.

267
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:05,474
You're not gonna kill me?

268
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:06,851
Don't tell me what to do!

269
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:31,960
Are you fucking kidding me?

270
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,141
Oh, so you <i>like</i> being alive?

271
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:48,977
So why the fuck
are you back here?

272
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:50,895
After you left,
I thought about what you said

273
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,480
and how much
I needed to hear it,

274
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,485
but then I thought about
why you were saying it,

275
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:56,025
who you were really
saying it to.

276
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,735
You need the same thing
I needed, Rick.

277
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,405
You need someone to give you,
permission to live.

278
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:02,156
What the...?

279
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:03,908
I thought you were a shy pooper.

280
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,660
You know what
shy pooping is, Rick?

281
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,537
It's a pointless bid
for control.

282
00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:09,122
You want to take
the one part of life

283
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:11,308
that you truly think is yours,
and you want to protect it

284
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:13,751
from a universe
that takes whatever it wants.

285
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:15,503
It took my wife.

286
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,588
It clearly took something
from you.

287
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:19,257
We can spend our lives
fighting that,

288
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:20,967
or we can choose to be free.

289
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:23,469
You're right, Tony.
I'm done fighting.

290
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:24,971
Time to be free.

291
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:26,156
Oh, wait,
you're actually gonna...

292
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,307
Oh, God! Oh, God!

293
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:34,439
- Where am I?
- Hi, little mouse.

294
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:36,983
Baby bee? I missed you so much.

295
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:38,526
I never really left you.

296
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,361
Then you know
that a few years ago

297
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:42,322
- I started getting into...
- Strap-on porn?

298
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:44,240
Yes. I thought it was hot.

299
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:46,200
- Now, come on.
- Where are you going?

300
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:47,577
- To poop.
- Where?

301
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:49,829
Wherever you want, forever.

302
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:50,955
My God.

303
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,208
You rang? Rm P00Ping, too.

304
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:55,668
Come, Tony. Come on.

305
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:58,004
Come poop with me.
Poop with me, Tony.

306
00:13:58,129 --> 00:13:59,380
Poop with me.

307
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:00,757
What are you waiting for?

308
00:14:00,882 --> 00:14:02,759
Aren't you gonna join us, Tony?

309
00:14:02,884 --> 00:14:05,178
Aren't you gonna join us
in the pooping?

310
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,339
Where are we? What is this?

311
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:24,572
That's it. Get out.

312
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,008
You can make
a perfectly-realized,

313
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:27,408
toilet-filled simulation
of heaven,

314
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:28,743
but you can't share a toilet?

315
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,078
Don't insult my craft.

316
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:31,662
The chemical is Globaflyn.

317
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:33,307
It connects the
whatever-you-want section

318
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:35,171
of your brain to the
whatever-you-have section.

319
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,585
If your heaven is toilets,
that's on you.

320
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,087
All of these people...

321
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:40,898
Are living their wildest,
meaningless dreams

322
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:42,632
and leaving me out of them.

323
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:45,593
People you refuse to kill and
refuse to let into your life.

324
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:49,055
An offer you rejected,
so here's your last chance.

325
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,432
Goodbye forever. If you touch
my toilet again, you die.

326
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:52,809
You need a friend.

327
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:54,203
I have a million
cooler friends than you.

328
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:55,704
<i>- I'll</i> be seeing you.
- You'll be dying.

329
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,814
- We're gonna be friends.
- You're gonna be dead.

330
00:14:57,939 --> 00:14:59,379
So, we fight our way
to the gas line,

331
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,817
we cut it,
and then we set a fire.

332
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:02,318
Okay. Alright.

333
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:04,163
Morty, "Adventures of Jerry
and Morty," huh?

334
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:05,589
- Put her there.
- Dad, look, y-you know,

335
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:06,757
w-we don't need to high-five.

336
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:08,008
It's... it's kind of your fault

337
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,134
that we're in this situation
at all.

338
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:10,785
I know, but, you know, come on.

339
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,245
"Adventures of Jerry and Morty."

340
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,455
<i>9K8'!-</i>

341
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:28,052
Mwah.

342
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,518
Jeff, I can explain everything.

343
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:36,727
You don't have to.

344
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:39,021
Can you just marry us instead?

345
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:40,148
Jeff, don't do it!

346
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:42,233
Richard.

347
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:43,609
Maggie.

348
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:46,654
- Running Bird.
- Let's get out of here.

349
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,489
- Priest Witherspoon.
- Josiah?

350
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:51,409
Let's get the fuck out of here.

351
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:54,328
Summer Smith, let's get
the hell out of here.

352
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:56,539
You had me at my own name.

353
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:59,375
Oh, yeah, no. Why would <i>l...?</i>

354
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,668
Summer!

355
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:01,836
Fucking thing.

356
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,130
Come on. I can't steer this.

357
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,342
What in the hell are you doing?

358
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:10,636
- Parenting.
- That's not how I did it.

359
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:12,388
Yeah, where's your daughter?

360
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:14,056
Ah, you're right.

361
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:15,808
She joined ISIS.

362
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:20,980
It's Glootie, and he's had
a change of heart.

363
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:22,607
And he's going to set us free.

364
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:24,859
Actually, he's been blamed
for bringing you aboard

365
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,110
and assigned to execute you.

366
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:27,737
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay.

367
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:30,198
What would your girlfriend
think of you murdering?

368
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:32,163
I happen to be between
relationships right now.

369
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,344
Really? I thought your species
had perfected relationships.

370
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:35,495
Here.

371
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:36,972
We're not allowed
to use those apps.

372
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,248
I wonder why.

373
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:41,125
Yeah, that's what I thought,
Glootie.

374
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,919
Looks like you and I...

375
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:44,545
are all we've got.

376
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:48,984
I'm not helping you
any more than that,

377
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,343
but if you can find the hangar,

378
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:51,987
grab a ship
and get the hell out of here.

379
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,346
Where you going, Glootie?

380
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:56,349
I've got a date
with dumping a dating app.

381
00:16:56,474 --> 00:16:58,351
Glootie-ootie-ooh!

382
00:16:58,476 --> 00:17:00,144
- Was that ever his thing?
- No.

383
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:02,146
- He never exited that way.
- No, first time.

384
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:03,814
Dad, I want to say something.

385
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:06,692
I started today disgusted
and embarrassed to be your son,

386
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:08,170
and then later I thought
we were gonna die

387
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:09,862
because you're a loser.

388
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:12,925
- There's no more, is there?
- Nope.

389
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:14,992
Now quit fucking up,
and let's go.

390
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:18,412
Is Tony here? I br...
I brought him some, uh,

391
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:20,623
Vegan Fiber Chili,
delicious family recipe,

392
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:22,588
and a box of these, uh,
chocolates, sugar free.

393
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,228
He can eat as many of these
as he wants.

394
00:17:24,252 --> 00:17:25,932
Anyways, uh, just wanted
to drop these off,

395
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,589
and you tell him, uh,
the toilet's all his.

396
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,049
H-He... he'll know what I mean.

397
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:31,842
Tony died.

398
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:35,179
- Excuse me?
- He quit his job,

399
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:37,640
starting living life
to the fullest.

400
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:38,849
He crashed into a tree

401
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:41,227
space-skiing
down Mount Space Everest.

402
00:17:41,352 --> 00:17:42,436
Fuck.

403
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:45,189
There's a Mount Space Everest?

404
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:46,774
Okay. Uh, Jesus.

405
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,277
I-I got to process this.

406
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:50,671
Oh, no, no. You...
You don't want to eat that.

407
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:52,130
Y-y-you'll... you'll...
You'll become

408
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:53,990
the opening
of "The Beverly Hillbillies."

409
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:56,200
You know what I'm saying?
A little bubbling crude?

410
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:58,369
- Texas tea?
- I don't know these references.

411
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,037
Yeah, but you have
a Space Everest?

412
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:02,039
Watch
"Space Beverly Hillbilllies"

413
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:05,001
so my jokes can land,
you fucking twat.

414
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,100
Now what?

415
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:23,477
Happily ever after.

416
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:24,854
And after that?

417
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:26,772
We'll find out together.

418
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:27,982
Summer.

419
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,867
How many soul mates is
that in the last week?

420
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:32,653
Four. You can't stop me
from loving who I love, Mom.

421
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,196
Oh, the shit I can't.

422
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:36,122
I'm gonna mother you
until your 18th birthday,

423
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:38,993
even if I get thrown in prison
for non-consensual mothering.

424
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,120
And even then, I will break out,

425
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:43,372
come to your house,
kick down your door,

426
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:46,167
and mother your fucking face
out of your stupid asshole.

427
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:48,210
I'm gonna daughter
your brains out, bitch.

428
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:58,838
<i>II.</i>

429
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:00,681
Motherfucker!

430
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,850
That's my name.
Don't wear it out.

431
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,981
Gimme dat new soul mate.

432
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:11,567
Ad Wall?

433
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:14,028
Fuck this.

434
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,196
Ad Wall?

435
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:16,761
What, they want us
to pay for it now?

436
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:20,159
Come on, Mom. Let's go home.

437
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:24,705
Great. We lost Earth.

438
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,958
We aren't defined by what we do,
and we only need each other.

439
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:29,835
Each other... and water.

440
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,170
There's no water?

441
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:32,648
Honey, the whole point
of conquering Earth...

442
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:34,382
I know the point
of conquering Earth.

443
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:36,550
- Don't talk to me like...
- Like I'm thirsty?

444
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:39,345
Like I'm your mother,
you childish prick.

445
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:40,930
How much water are you sucking

446
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:42,783
through these stupid
fucking tubes on your back?

447
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:44,850
These tubes are cool,
and I want a divorce.

448
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:49,188
You can have one for a glass
of Goddamn water.

449
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:52,858
Look, uh, on the off-chance
that you used the app

450
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:56,487
and there's someone out there
waiting for you, I, uh...

451
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:59,448
Jerry, I didn't use it. Did you?

452
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,951
Me? No. God, of course not.

453
00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:03,869
Well, then,
we're all good, dawg.

454
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:12,920
Hey, uh... Hey, uh, Tony's dad,

455
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:16,382
uh, th-this is, um, $8 billion
in your local currency,

456
00:20:16,507 --> 00:20:20,136
and, uh, this is a kit
you can use to clone a new son.

457
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:21,887
He... he won't have
the same brain.

458
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:24,765
He'll kind of be an animal man,
but you can teach him stuff.

459
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,159
I-I-I also wanted
to let you know

460
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:27,685
I did explore
infinite universes,

461
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:30,187
and there is a version of Tony
that was completely evil

462
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:31,792
and ended up causing
a lot of genocide

463
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:33,315
because of how fulfilled he was.

464
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:35,161
So, really, a lot of ways
of looking at this

465
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,528
as not much of a loss.

466
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:39,155
I understand.

467
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,991
It's, uh, hard losing a friend.

468
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:43,242
- Fuck you.
- What?

469
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:45,077
He's not my friend.

470
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:05,139
<i>There he is. There's our guy.</i>

471
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,390
Congrats, <i>Tony.</i>

472
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:07,975
<i>Have fun with your stupid toilet</i>

473
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,060
<i>that you get to use
all by yourself now.</i>

474
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:12,229
<i>Enjoy using it all by yourself
while you sit there</i>

475
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:14,166
<i>and think about how nobody
wants to be around you</i>

476
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:15,566
<i>and how you ruined it
for yourself</i>

477
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:17,002
<i>because you're
a huge piece of shit.</i>

478
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:18,360
<i>Look at you sitting there,</i>

479
00:21:18,486 --> 00:21:20,696
<i>King Shit on his throne
of loneliness.</i>

480
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:22,907
<i>Enjoy this toilet with
a thousand of me</i>

481
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:25,242
<i>screaming every time
you take a shit.</i>

482
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:27,244
<i>All hail his majesty,</i>

483
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:31,582
<i>the sa-a-ddest piece of garbage
in the entire cosmos.</i>

484
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:34,752
<i>Long live the big, bad,
doo-doo daddy.</i>

485
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:38,005
<i>May his reign last 1,000 years.</i>

486
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:14,333
Rick, did you take the Tapatio?

487
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:16,460
Hmm, Globaflyn?

488
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:20,673
Thanks.
I could never lift it up.

489
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:22,299
No problem.

490
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:25,344
I'll be able to drink water
for weeks because of you.

491
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:27,596
It's just part of my job, ma'am.

492
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:31,684
Breaker one nine,
this is Jerry Smith.

493
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:33,894
Uh, just finished
my first delivery of the day.

494
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:35,229
900 more to go.
