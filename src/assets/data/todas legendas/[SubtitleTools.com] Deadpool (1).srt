1
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:04,350
Kinda lonesome back here.

2
00:03:04,808 --> 00:03:05,848
Yeah, little help.

3
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:11,646
Okay, just, I have to keep my hands on the wheel.

4
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:14,479
Excuse me.

5
00:03:16,153 --> 00:03:17,453
Dopinder.

6
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:19,488
Pool. Dead.

7
00:03:21,158 --> 00:03:22,158
Nice.

8
00:03:23,285 --> 00:03:24,405
Smells good, no?

9
00:03:24,453 --> 00:03:26,333
Not the Daffodil Daydream. The girl.

10
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:29,879
Yes. Gita. She is quite lovely.

11
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:33,996
She would have made me a very agreeable wife.

12
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:38,340
But, Gita's heart has been stolen by my cousin Bandhu.

13
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:42,354
He is as dishonorable as he is attractive.

14
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:47,354
Dopinder, I'm starting to think there's a reason I'm in this cab today.

15
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:49,145
Yeah, sir, you called for it, remember?

16
00:03:49,186 --> 00:03:54,016
No, my slender brown friend. Love is a beautiful thing.

17
00:03:54,066 --> 00:03:56,856
When you find it, the whole world tastes like Daffodil Daydream.

18
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:59,860
So you gotta hold onto love...

19
00:04:00,197 --> 00:04:01,657
tight!

20
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:04,659
And never let go. Don't make the same mistakes I did.

21
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:05,952
- Got it? - Yeah.

22
00:04:05,994 --> 00:04:09,504
Or else the whole world tastes like Mama June after hot yoga.

23
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,380
Sir, what does Miss Mama June taste like?

24
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:15,378
- Like two hobos fucking in a shoe filled with piss. - Okay, enough.

25
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:18,341
I can go all day, Dopinder. The point is, it's bad!

26
00:04:18,382 --> 00:04:20,092
It's bad.

27
00:04:20,676 --> 00:04:23,346
Why the fancy red suit, Mr. Pool?

28
00:04:23,387 --> 00:04:25,347
That's because it's Christmas Day, Dopinder.

29
00:04:25,389 --> 00:04:27,889
And I'm after someone on my naughty list.

30
00:04:27,933 --> 00:04:29,523
I've been waiting one year, three weeks...

31
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,520
six days and...

32
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:33,902
14 minutes to make him fix what he did to me.

33
00:04:35,524 --> 00:04:37,864
And what did he do to you, Mr. Pool?

34
00:04:37,901 --> 00:04:39,241
This shit...

35
00:04:40,779 --> 00:04:41,779
Boo!

36
00:05:02,384 --> 00:05:03,474
They won't disappoint.

37
00:05:04,136 --> 00:05:05,926
They'd better not.

38
00:05:05,971 --> 00:05:08,391
And what about next month's shipment?

39
00:05:08,432 --> 00:05:10,182
There won't be one.

40
00:05:10,225 --> 00:05:11,865
You're not the only one with a war to win.

41
00:05:12,978 --> 00:05:14,398
That won't do.

42
00:05:17,316 --> 00:05:21,236
See, we've had this small disruption to our supply chain...

43
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:27,284
We'd appreciate your patience.

44
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:30,787
Okay.

45
00:05:31,288 --> 00:05:33,788
We'll deliver in full the following month.

46
00:05:37,294 --> 00:05:38,614
Pleasure doing business with you.

47
00:05:42,299 --> 00:05:44,009
Fucking mutant.

48
00:05:54,019 --> 00:05:55,599
Ah, shit!

49
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:57,016
I forgot my ammo bag.

50
00:05:57,356 --> 00:05:59,606
- Shall we turn back? - No, no time.

51
00:06:00,025 --> 00:06:01,605
Fuck it. I got this.

52
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:04,992
9, 10, 11, 12 bullets, or bust.

53
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:06,030
Right here!

54
00:06:08,033 --> 00:06:10,623
That's $27.50.

55
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:12,371
I never carry a wallet when I'm working.

56
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:13,833
Ruins the lines of my suit.

57
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,750
But, how about a crisp high five?

58
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:17,956
Okay.

59
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:19,252
Merry Christmas.

60
00:06:20,587 --> 00:06:23,587
And a convivial Tuesday in April to you too, Pool!

61
00:06:27,219 --> 00:06:32,099
Shoop shooop ba-doop, shoop ba-doop Shoop ba-doop, ba-doop, ba-doop

62
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:34,141
You're packed and you're stacked 'specially in the back

63
00:06:34,184 --> 00:06:36,944
Brother, wanna thank your mother for a butt like that

64
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:39,399
Can I get some fries with that shake-shake boobie?

65
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,650
If looks could kill you would be an uzi

66
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:43,152
You're a shotgun - bang!

67
00:06:44,903 --> 00:06:48,243
Oh, hello. I know, right?

68
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:51,992
Whose balls did I have to fondle to get my very own movie?

69
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:55,616
I can't tell you, but it does rhyme with Polverine.

70
00:06:55,873 --> 00:07:01,423
And let me tell you, he's got a nice pair of smooth criminals down under.

71
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:05,672
Anyway, I got places to be, a face to fix and...

72
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:08,386
Bad guys to kill.

73
00:07:13,807 --> 00:07:15,057
Maximum effort.

74
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:26,069
Cock shot.

75
00:07:33,702 --> 00:07:35,792
Rich Corinthian leather.

76
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:39,578
I'm looking for Francis!

77
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:41,415
Have you seen this man?

78
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:52,762
Yanky, yanky!

79
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:27,669
I've never said this, but don't swallow.

80
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,528
Shit.

81
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:53,165
Did I leave the stove on?

82
00:09:10,674 --> 00:09:12,014
Now, breaking news.

83
00:09:12,384 --> 00:09:15,934
A multi-car collision turned shots fired on the crosstown expressway this morning.

84
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:18,217
Gridlock has kept police from the scene.

85
00:09:18,682 --> 00:09:21,182
Residents are advised to remain in their homes.

86
00:09:21,226 --> 00:09:24,306
The assailant appears to be armed, dangerous, and wearing...

87
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:25,775
- a red suit. - A red suit.

88
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,690
Deadpool.

89
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:30,443
Negasonic! Come, we have mission.

90
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:33,822
Colossus, wait up.

91
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:37,244
I've given Deadpool every chance to join us...

92
00:09:37,284 --> 00:09:39,494
but he'd rather act like a child.

93
00:09:39,536 --> 00:09:42,036
A heavily-armed child.

94
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:45,831
When will he grow up and see benefits of becoming X-Man?

95
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:47,706
Which benefits? The matching unitards?

96
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:49,925
The house that blows up every few years?

97
00:09:49,963 --> 00:09:51,013
Please.

98
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:53,378
House blowing up builds character.

99
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:55,764
You ate breakfast, yes?

100
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:58,053
Breakfast is most important meal of day.

101
00:09:58,972 --> 00:10:03,272
Here, protein bar. Good for bones.

102
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:05,650
Deadpool may try to break yours.

103
00:10:14,321 --> 00:10:15,451
Get out of the way!

104
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:34,467
Hey!

105
00:10:45,644 --> 00:10:46,944
Wait!

106
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:49,401
You may be wondering, Why the red suit?

107
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,360
Well, that's so bad guys can't see me bleed.

108
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:53,611
This guy's got the right idea.

109
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:55,284
He wore the brown pants.

110
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:59,409
Fine! I only have 12 bullets...

111
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:01,120
so you're gonna have to share!

112
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,950
Let's count them down.

113
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:23,426
Shit.

114
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:28,187
Motherfucker!

115
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,610
10! Shit!

116
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:32,273
Nine. Fuck.

117
00:11:32,649 --> 00:11:33,649
Eight.

118
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:34,859
Shit-fuck!

119
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:39,824
Bad Deadpool.

120
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:43,453
Seven. Good Deadpool.

121
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:08,234
Someone's not counting. Six.

122
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:36,047
Four.

123
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:39,422
Gotcha.

124
00:12:41,176 --> 00:12:42,426
Right up Main Street.

125
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:47,635
Three, two!

126
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:49,563
Stupid! Worth it.

127
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:17,879
I'm touching myself tonight.

128
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:19,804
Francis!

129
00:13:20,215 --> 00:13:21,415
Francis...

130
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:25,677
What the shit-biscuit!

131
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:27,431
Where you at, Francis?

132
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:37,397
You're not Francis.

133
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:47,869
Really? Rolling up the sleeves?

134
00:13:58,253 --> 00:14:01,553
You're probably thinking, My boyfriend said this was a superhero movie...

135
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:05,390
but that guy in the red suit just turned that other guy into a fucking kabab!

136
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:09,966
Well, I may be super, but I'm no hero.

137
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:12,517
And, yeah, technically, this is a murder.

138
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:14,849
But some of the best love stories start with a murder.

139
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:17,935
And that's exactly what this is. A love story.

140
00:14:17,981 --> 00:14:19,401
And to tell it right...

141
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:24,241
I gotta take you back to long before I squeezed this ass into red spandex.

142
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:30,292
Look, would it help if I slow it down for you? I didn't order the pizza.

143
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:34,117
Is this 7348 Red Ledge Drive? Are you Mr. Merchant?

144
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:37,294
Yeah, the Mr. Merchant who didn't order the fucking pie!

145
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:38,788
Then who placed the call?

146
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,670
I did!

147
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:44,417
Pineapple and olive?

148
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:47,887
Sweet and salty.

149
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:51,058
The fuck are you? The fuck you doing in my crib...

150
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:52,098
Is it burnt crust?

151
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:53,639
God, I hope not.

152
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:56,138
Man, look, if this is about that poker game.

153
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:58,476
I told Howie, I told him that...

154
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:02,482
Okay, look, just take whatever you want.

155
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:03,606
Thanks.

156
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:07,168
Sir, before you do anything to him, do you mind if I get a big tip?

157
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:10,579
Jeremy, is it?

158
00:15:10,617 --> 00:15:12,037
Wade. Wade Wilson.

159
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:16,162
That is a no go on the tiperoo, Jer.

160
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:17,666
I'm not here for him.

161
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,632
I'm here for you.

162
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,170
Okay, wow, dodged a big-time bullet on that one.

163
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:25,133
Not out of the woods yet.

164
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:28,086
You need to seriously ease up on the bedazzling.

165
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:30,105
They're jeans, not a chandelier.

166
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:32,427
P.S. I'm keeping your wallet. You did kinda give it to me.

167
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:34,273
Okay, just look, man, can I have my Sam's card...

168
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:36,558
I will shoot your fucking cat!

169
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:39,814
I don't really know what that means. I don't have a cat.

170
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:41,897
Then whose kitty litter did I just shit in?

171
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:48,198
Anyhoo, tell me something...

172
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:51,988
what situation isn't improved by pizza?

173
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:54,374
Do you happen to know a Meghan Orflosky?

174
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:56,041
Getting that right? Orflosky?

175
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,370
Orlovsky? Yeah? Good.

176
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:00,883
Because she knows you.

177
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:05,378
Jeremy, I belong to a group of guys who take a dime to beat a fella down.

178
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:08,342
And little Meghan, she's not made of money, but lucky for her...

179
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:09,684
I got a soft spot.

180
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,220
- But I'm a... - A stalker.

181
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,310
Threats hurt, Jer.

182
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:17,808
Though not nearly as badly as serrated steel.

183
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:21,061
So keep away from Meghan.

184
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:22,025
Cool?

185
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:23,324
Yes, sir.

186
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:24,357
Then we're done.

187
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:26,738
Wait. We are?

188
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:28,447
Yeah. We're totally done.

189
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:30,573
You should've seen your face.

190
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:31,914
I didn't know what to do. I was so scared.

191
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:33,279
Soft spot, remember?

192
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:36,875
You even look in her general direction again...

193
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:40,622
and you will learn in the worst of ways that I have some hard spots too.

194
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:43,956
That came out wrong.

195
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:46,299
Or did it?

196
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:00,601
Meghan?

197
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:05,367
You've heard the last of Jeremy. He's sorry.

198
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:07,823
No friggin' way.

199
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:15,276
Should've brought my roller blades. Show these kids how it's done.

200
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:18,866
And that's why we do it. But mostly the money.

201
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:20,792
Hey, think you could fuck up my step-dad?

202
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:23,501
I give a guy a pavement facial, it's because he's earned it.

203
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:25,458
Hey, wait!

204
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:28,257
You're my hero.

205
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:30,797
No-no-no-no. That I ain't!

206
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:34,966
Nope. Never will be.

207
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:36,846
Fuck you, Wade.

208
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:40,681
I'm just a bad guy who gets paid to fuck up worse guys.

209
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:43,734
Welcome to Sister Margaret's.

210
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:46,111
It's like a job fair for mercenaries.

211
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:48,824
Think of us as really fucked up tooth fairies...

212
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:51,569
except we knock out the teeth and take the cash.

213
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:54,662
You'd best hope we never see your name on a gold card.

214
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:56,528
Buck! Liefeld...

215
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:57,867
Hey, Wade!

216
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:00,832
Wade Wilson, patron saint of the pitiful. What can I do for you?

217
00:18:01,372 --> 00:18:02,622
I'd love a Blow Job.

218
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:04,173
Oh, God, me too.

219
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:06,208
The drink, moose knuckle. But first...

220
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:09,918
Hey, and I ain't taking any babysitting money, all right?

221
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:11,803
Make sure that gets back to Ms...

222
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,840
Orlovsky.

223
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:13,843
Yeah, her.

224
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:15,144
You sure?

225
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:17,846
You know, for a merc, you're pretty warm-blooded.

226
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:19,808
I bet you let the kid off easy, too.

227
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:21,768
He's not a bad kid, Weas.

228
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:23,189
Just a little light stalking.

229
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:24,687
I was way worse than him when I was his age.

230
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:26,648
I was traveling to exotic places...

231
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:30,689
Baghdad, Mogadishu, Jacksonville, meeting new and exciting people. And then...

232
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:33,031
Killing them. Yeah, I've seen your Instagram.

233
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:35,784
So what was Special Forces doing in Jacksonville, anyway?

234
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:37,373
That's classified.

235
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:39,698
They have a wonderful TGI Fridays.

236
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:42,043
All right, Kahlua, Baileys and...

237
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,369
whipped cream.

238
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:45,504
I give you a Blow Job.

239
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:47,379
Why do you make me make that?

240
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:49,208
Kelly, Kelly, Kelly...

241
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:52,713
Take that over to Buck, please, and tell him it's from Boothe. Little foreplay.

242
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:55,046
Remind me what good will come of this?

243
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:57,142
I don't take the shits. I just disturb them.

244
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:58,177
Boothe!

245
00:18:58,554 --> 00:18:59,724
- Easy, man. - Hold up! Hold up!

246
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:00,763
What you want?

247
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,890
- Cheers. To your health. - Fuck you.

248
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:08,565
Come here, you fat fuck!

249
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:10,065
That's a new stool.

250
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:16,395
Stay the fuck down.

251
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:20,744
Whoa! Took his ass out!

252
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:22,704
All right, move. Move, move, move.

253
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:23,795
Buck, go rest.

254
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:26,412
Boothe got hit then went down.

255
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,880
Yeah, he's still breathing.

256
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:37,089
Nobody wins today.

257
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:38,764
Nice try, Wade.

258
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:42,432
You got me. I picked Boothe in the dead pool. Who did you pick?

259
00:19:42,473 --> 00:19:44,433
Yeah, Wade, about that...

260
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:45,933
No.

261
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:47,983
You did not bet on me to die.

262
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:54,396
You bet on me to die. Wow. Motherfucker, you're the world's worst friend.

263
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:57,108
Well, joke's on you. I'm living to 102.

264
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:59,414
And then dying. Like the city of Detroit.

265
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:02,278
I'm sorry. I just... I wanted to win money.

266
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:03,616
I never win anything.

267
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,790
Whatever.

268
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:06,408
Soldiers of fortune, drinks on me!

269
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:10,752
Domestic, nothing imported.

270
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:18,677
Baby, are you sure you wanna shoot your whole wad?

271
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:21,969
Tight.

272
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:25,599
- Vanessa. - Wade.

273
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:28,103
What's a nice place like you doing in a girl like this?

274
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:30,728
I'd hit that.

275
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:33,822
Buck, you best apologize before...

276
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:36,356
Yeah, that.

277
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:38,072
Say the magic words, Fat Gandalf.

278
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:39,992
- I'm sorry. - Breathe through the nose.

279
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:42,200
I don't have a filter between my brain and my...

280
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:43,491
Let go. Okay. Hey...

281
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,753
- Hakuna his tatas. He's sorry. - I'm working on it.

282
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:48,747
Get out of here. Go. Go cast a spell.

283
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:51,751
Hey. Hands off the merchandise.

284
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:54,343
Merchandise?

285
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:57,297
So you...

286
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:58,759
bump fuzzies for money?

287
00:20:58,799 --> 00:20:59,549
Yep.

288
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:00,841
Rough childhood?

289
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:01,934
Rougher than yours.

290
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:03,549
Daddy left before I was born.

291
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:05,719
Daddy left before I was conceived.

292
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,572
Ever had a cigarette put out on your skin?

293
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:09,982
Where else do you put one out?

294
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:11,309
I was molested.

295
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:13,063
Me too. Uncle.

296
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,405
Uncles. They took turns.

297
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:18,321
I watched my own birthday party through the keyhole of a locked closet...

298
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,740
which also happens to be my...

299
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:22,608
Your bedroom. Lucky. I slept in a dishwasher box.

300
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:24,739
You had a dishwasher.

301
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,370
I didn't even know sleep.

302
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:29,660
It was pretty much 24/7 ball gags, brownie mix and clown porn.

303
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:34,959
Who would do such a thing?

304
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:40,088
Hopefully you, later tonight?

305
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:47,846
Hey, what can I get for $275 and a...

306
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:50,768
a Yogurtland rewards card?

307
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:53,439
Baby, about 48 minutes of whatever the fuck you want.

308
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:56,647
And a low-fat dessert.

309
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:05,945
Did she just put a gift card in your mouth?

310
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:09,414
It's time to put balls in holes.

311
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:11,964
You said whatever I want.

312
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:13,790
I get it.

313
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:15,633
You love skee ball.

314
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:17,958
Apparently more than you love vagina.

315
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,463
That's a tough call.

316
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,629
I just wanna get to know the real you, you know.

317
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:26,515
Not the short-shorted, two-dimensional sex object peddled by Hollywood.

318
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:27,929
Balls in holes.

319
00:22:28,806 --> 00:22:29,806
Balls in holes.

320
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,425
Prepare to lose tragically.

321
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:32,605
Bring it, big man.

322
00:22:32,643 --> 00:22:33,643
Okay.

323
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:44,363
The limited edition Voltron: Defender of the Universe ring, por favor.

324
00:22:44,822 --> 00:22:47,322
Okay. Here we go.

325
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:50,413
Had my eye on this sucker for a while.

326
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:52,292
And I will take the pencil eraser.

327
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:53,749
Okay.

328
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:56,579
You are now the protector of the planet Arus.

329
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,585
And you can erase stuff...

330
00:22:58,627 --> 00:22:59,957
written in pencil.

331
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:01,757
M'lady?

332
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:03,127
Well, I hate to break it to you...

333
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:05,013
but your 48 minutes are up.

334
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:08,299
Hey, how many more minutes can I get for this?

335
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:12,845
FYI, five mini lion-bots come together to form one super-bot, so...

336
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:16,313
Five mini lion-bots? Three minutes.

337
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:17,313
Deal.

338
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:19,654
What do we do with the remaining two minutes, 37 seconds?

339
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:21,733
Cuddle?

340
00:23:25,863 --> 00:23:27,363
How long can you keep this up?

341
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:28,823
All year?

342
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:41,215
Happy Valentine's Day.

343
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:50,474
Happy Chinese New Year.

344
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:51,852
Year of the Dog.

345
00:23:57,061 --> 00:23:58,231
Relax.

346
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:00,902
And Happy International Women's Day.

347
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:08,569
No. No. No.

348
00:24:10,908 --> 00:24:12,078
Happy Lent.

349
00:24:17,331 --> 00:24:18,621
- Wade? - Sorry.

350
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:19,995
Happy Halloween.

351
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:21,376
Happy Halloween.

352
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:32,721
Happy Thanksgiving.

353
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:35,933
I love you.

354
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:41,808
If your left leg is Thanksgiving...

355
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:43,515
and your right leg is Christmas...

356
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:46,358
can I visit you between the holidays?

357
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:50,108
That sweater is terrible.

358
00:24:51,115 --> 00:24:52,825
But red looks good on you.

359
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:53,986
Red's your color.

360
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:55,794
Brings out the bloodshot in your eyes.

361
00:24:56,704 --> 00:24:57,914
Listen, I've been thinking...

362
00:24:57,955 --> 00:24:58,955
Really?

363
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:01,293
...about why we're so good together.

364
00:25:01,709 --> 00:25:02,789
Why's that?

365
00:25:04,795 --> 00:25:07,305
Your crazy matches my crazy. Big time.

366
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:12,430
And, we're like two jigsaw pieces, you know, the weird curvy edges...

367
00:25:12,803 --> 00:25:15,223
You put them together and you can see the picture on top.

368
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:17,223
Right.

369
00:25:17,725 --> 00:25:18,815
Wade...

370
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:22,056
there's something I've been meaning to ask you.

371
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:24,614
But only because you haven't gotten around to asking me.

372
00:25:26,734 --> 00:25:27,784
Will you...

373
00:25:28,986 --> 00:25:30,896
- stick it in my... - Marry me?

374
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:34,907
Jinx?

375
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:37,945
Where were you hiding that?

376
00:25:37,995 --> 00:25:39,005
Nowhere.

377
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,750
They say one month's salary. So...

378
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:42,790
You mean?

379
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:43,963
I do.

380
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:45,001
That's my line.

381
00:25:48,339 --> 00:25:49,969
I love you, Wade Wilson.

382
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,129
You're supposed to... So that's a...

383
00:25:52,176 --> 00:25:53,176
Yes!

384
00:25:54,428 --> 00:25:55,508
Yes!

385
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:59,099
I feel just like a little girl.

386
00:26:04,438 --> 00:26:06,768
What if I just held on and never let go?

387
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:09,355
Just ride a bitch's back, like Yoda on Luke.

388
00:26:10,361 --> 00:26:11,861
Star Wars jokes.

389
00:26:12,321 --> 00:26:13,531
Empire.

390
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:18,200
Jesus Christ. It's like I made you in a computer.

391
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:23,539
Hey.

392
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:25,635
Perfect.

393
00:26:29,797 --> 00:26:31,297
- Let's see. - All right, wee break.

394
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:32,630
Shake it, yeah.

395
00:26:38,889 --> 00:26:40,019
Here's the thing.

396
00:26:40,391 --> 00:26:42,351
Life is an endless series of train-wrecks...

397
00:26:42,393 --> 00:26:45,903
with only brief, commercial-like breaks of happiness.

398
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:49,565
This had been the ultimate commercial break.

399
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:55,277
Which meant it was time to return to our regularly scheduled program.

400
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:56,322
What the...

401
00:26:57,199 --> 00:26:58,329
Oh, my God. Wade?

402
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:05,873
You're clowning.

403
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:07,755
You're not clowning?

404
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:09,168
I sense clowns.

405
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:13,086
People react to news of late-stage cancer differently.

406
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:17,682
There are certainly options we can look into. New drugs are being developed every day.

407
00:27:22,224 --> 00:27:23,354
So what do we do?

408
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:26,186
Surely there is something we can do.

409
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:29,984
My uncle Ivan was diagnosed with thyroid cancer...

410
00:27:30,024 --> 00:27:32,574
and there were all these new experimental drugs from Germany.

411
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:36,859
Vanessa's already working on Plan A, B, all the way through Z.

412
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:40,696
Me? I'm memorizing the details of her face.

413
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:43,748
Like it's the first time I'm seeing it.

414
00:27:44,121 --> 00:27:44,961
Or the last.

415
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:46,497
Mr. Wilson...

416
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:47,960
Mr. Wilson?

417
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:50,665
Take your time to process this.

418
00:27:51,712 --> 00:27:53,632
It's important not to do anything rash.

419
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:10,444
Now, if I were a 200-pound sack of assholes named Francis, where would I hide?

420
00:28:35,923 --> 00:28:40,303
A hush falls over the crowd as rookie sensation Wade W. Wilson...

421
00:28:40,344 --> 00:28:43,814
out of Regina, Saskatchewan, lines up the shot.

422
00:28:45,474 --> 00:28:47,144
His form looks good.

423
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:53,059
And that's why Regina rhymes with fun.

424
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:55,979
Ladies and gentlemen, what you're witnessing...

425
00:28:56,026 --> 00:28:58,276
is sweet dick-kicking revenge.

426
00:28:59,321 --> 00:29:00,781
Giving him the business.

427
00:29:01,365 --> 00:29:02,365
Incoming!

428
00:29:03,409 --> 00:29:07,159
This is taking unsportsmanlike conduct to a whole new level!

429
00:29:12,501 --> 00:29:16,171
Looking good, Francis. Well rested. Like you've been pitching, not catching.

430
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:18,715
Ringing any bells? No?

431
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:24,929
How about now?

432
00:29:28,934 --> 00:29:31,104
Wade fucking Wilson.

433
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:34,895
Well, hello, gorgeous.

434
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:37,940
Yeah, like I got bit by a radioactive Shar-Pei.

435
00:29:37,985 --> 00:29:41,155
Yeah. And whose fault is that, huh, Francis?

436
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:43,236
Yeah, time to undo what you did to this butterface.

437
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:46,282
Please, you should thank me. Apparently, I made you immortal.

438
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:48,248
I'm actually quite jealous.

439
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:50,537
Yeah, but this ain't a life worth living, is it?

440
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:56,754
Now, I'm about to do to you what Limp Bizkit did to music in the late 90s.

441
00:29:59,173 --> 00:30:00,173
Dad?

442
00:30:03,552 --> 00:30:07,972
I think we can all agree that shit just went sideways in the most colossal way.

443
00:30:09,016 --> 00:30:10,976
Well, maybe not the most.

444
00:30:12,561 --> 00:30:15,231
This is my most prized possession.

445
00:30:15,898 --> 00:30:16,858
Wham?

446
00:30:16,899 --> 00:30:18,729
No, no, no. Wham!

447
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:22,738
Make It Big is the album that George and Andy earned the exclamation point.

448
00:30:23,781 --> 00:30:26,701
So, am I supposed to just smile and wave you out the door?

449
00:30:26,742 --> 00:30:28,332
Think of it like spring cleaning.

450
00:30:28,369 --> 00:30:29,659
Only if spring was death.

451
00:30:29,703 --> 00:30:33,673
God, if I had a nickel for every time I spanked it to Bernadette Peters.

452
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:36,168
Sounds like you do.

453
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:40,962
Bernadette is not going anywhere, because you're not going anywhere.

454
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:42,006
Drink.

455
00:30:42,216 --> 00:30:44,966
You're right. Cancer is only in my liver, lungs, prostate, and brain.

456
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:46,210
All things I can live without.

457
00:30:48,472 --> 00:30:50,472
You belong here at home.

458
00:30:50,516 --> 00:30:54,136
Surrounded by your Voltron and your Bernadette, and your me.

459
00:30:55,479 --> 00:30:58,939
Listen, we both know that cancer is a shit-show.

460
00:31:00,609 --> 00:31:06,869
Like, a Yakov-Smirnoff-opening-for-the- Spin-Doctors-at-the-Iowa-State-Fair shit-show.

461
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:12,156
And under no circumstances will I take you to that show.

462
00:31:13,539 --> 00:31:15,169
I want you to remember me.

463
00:31:16,709 --> 00:31:18,539
Not the ghost of Christmas me.

464
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:20,375
Well, I wanna remember us.

465
00:31:20,838 --> 00:31:22,508
I swear to God, I will find you in the next life...

466
00:31:22,548 --> 00:31:25,718
and I'm gonna boom-box Careless Whisper outside your window.

467
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:27,179
Wham!

468
00:31:30,556 --> 00:31:33,556
No one is boom-boxing shit. Okay?

469
00:31:36,145 --> 00:31:37,525
We can fight this.

470
00:31:40,691 --> 00:31:42,861
Besides, I just realized something.

471
00:31:43,694 --> 00:31:48,824
You win. Your life is officially way more fucked up than mine.

472
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:54,245
I love you.

473
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,054
Wade.

474
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:10,471
Weas.

475
00:32:10,512 --> 00:32:13,062
You look like you need a Blow Job and a shower.

476
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:15,228
Though courtesy calls for the latter first.

477
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:16,937
How about three shots of Patrón?

478
00:32:16,977 --> 00:32:20,727
Or how about Triticum aestivum, wheatgrass.

479
00:32:20,773 --> 00:32:22,153
Excellent for the immune system.

480
00:32:22,191 --> 00:32:24,281
Jesus Christ. You sound like Vanessa.

481
00:32:24,318 --> 00:32:25,488
Here, check it out.

482
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:28,987
She's sending away for all these colorful clinic brochures.

483
00:32:29,031 --> 00:32:30,781
I'm sure they're all FDA approved.

484
00:32:31,241 --> 00:32:34,201
Chechnya. Isn't that where you go to get cancer?

485
00:32:34,244 --> 00:32:37,004
You got China and Central Mexico.

486
00:32:37,456 --> 00:32:39,706
You know how they say cancer in Spanish?

487
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:40,790
No.

488
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,170
El Cáncer.

489
00:32:43,212 --> 00:32:45,052
I could have guessed that.

490
00:32:45,422 --> 00:32:46,972
Look how happy you look here.

491
00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:51,007
Mind if I keep this? Put it up, so I can remember when you looked alive.

492
00:32:51,512 --> 00:32:53,472
At least now I'm gonna win the dead pool.

493
00:32:53,514 --> 00:32:56,224
Now that you're gonna die tragically of cancer.

494
00:32:56,266 --> 00:32:57,846
I got it, Weas. Thanks.

495
00:33:00,646 --> 00:33:03,316
And that guy over there came in looking for you.

496
00:33:03,357 --> 00:33:06,227
Real Grim Reaper type.

497
00:33:06,276 --> 00:33:08,236
I don't know. Might further the plot.

498
00:33:12,241 --> 00:33:13,331
Boothe.

499
00:33:13,367 --> 00:33:14,447
Wade.

500
00:33:19,832 --> 00:33:20,832
Mr. Wilson.

501
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:22,420
How can I help you?

502
00:33:22,459 --> 00:33:25,169
Besides luring children into a panel van.

503
00:33:25,212 --> 00:33:28,882
I understand you've recently been diagnosed with terminal cancer.

504
00:33:28,924 --> 00:33:30,054
Stalker alert.

505
00:33:30,092 --> 00:33:32,262
It's my job. Recruitment.

506
00:33:33,012 --> 00:33:35,432
I'm sorry you've had such a tough go.

507
00:33:36,557 --> 00:33:38,847
But you're a fighter. Special Forces.

508
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:41,232
41 confirmed kills.

509
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:43,190
One every seven weeks.

510
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:45,110
Same rate most folks get a haircut.

511
00:33:46,275 --> 00:33:47,535
It's to wash the taste out.

512
00:33:47,818 --> 00:33:51,028
It's tough to forget being so impressive.

513
00:33:51,071 --> 00:33:55,161
And now you spend your days sticking up for the little people...

514
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,740
People change. What do you want?

515
00:33:57,119 --> 00:34:00,159
I represent an organization that may be able to help.

516
00:34:02,124 --> 00:34:05,794
What if I told you we can cure your cancer?

517
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:10,510
And what's more, give you abilities most men only dream of?

518
00:34:14,178 --> 00:34:18,268
I'd say that you sound like an infomercial, but not a good one, like Slap Chop.

519
00:34:18,307 --> 00:34:19,927
More Shake Weight-y.

520
00:34:19,975 --> 00:34:22,975
The world needs extraordinary soldiers.

521
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:25,190
We won't just make you better.

522
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:28,190
We will make you better than better.

523
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:30,494
A superhero.

524
00:34:30,819 --> 00:34:35,819
Look, Agent Smith, I tried the hero business and it left a mark.

525
00:34:36,283 --> 00:34:38,913
But if I ever hit fuck it, I'll look you up.

526
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:44,170
Shit. We're within 500 yards of a school, so you may wanna...

527
00:34:49,171 --> 00:34:50,381
His drink's on him.

528
00:34:56,053 --> 00:34:57,803
What did he say?

529
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:22,042
Hey, what's going on?

530
00:35:23,038 --> 00:35:24,538
Hey. Sorry.

531
00:35:25,999 --> 00:35:27,999
I had a Liam Neeson nightmare.

532
00:35:28,877 --> 00:35:32,047
I dreamt I kidnapped his daughter and he just wasn't having it.

533
00:35:39,763 --> 00:35:43,983
Hey, they've made three of those movies.

534
00:35:44,977 --> 00:35:48,147
At some point you have to wonder if he's just a bad parent.

535
00:36:02,536 --> 00:36:06,156
The worst part about cancer isn't what it does to you...

536
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:09,420
but what it does to the people you love.

537
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:12,420
Who knew if this guy could save my life...

538
00:36:12,463 --> 00:36:15,013
but I knew there was only one way that I could save hers.

539
00:36:19,178 --> 00:36:21,428
Isn't that what superheroes do?

540
00:36:33,776 --> 00:36:37,816
Okay. Let's pro-con this superhero thing.

541
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:42,700
Pro: They pull down a gaggle of ass.

542
00:36:42,743 --> 00:36:44,123
Local dry cleaning discounts.

543
00:36:44,161 --> 00:36:48,211
Lucrative film deals, both origin stories and larger ensemble team movies.

544
00:36:48,248 --> 00:36:51,418
Con: They're all lame-ass teacher's pets.

545
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:53,170
You know, I can hear you.

546
00:36:53,212 --> 00:36:56,382
I wasn't talking to you. I was talking to them.

547
00:36:56,423 --> 00:36:58,133
Stay right here.

548
00:36:58,509 --> 00:37:00,589
You've been warned before, Deadpool.

549
00:37:00,886 --> 00:37:04,506
This is a shameful and reckless use of your powers.

550
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:06,766
You will both be coming with us.

551
00:37:06,809 --> 00:37:10,729
Look, Colossus, I don't have time for the goody two-shoes bullshit right now!

552
00:37:10,771 --> 00:37:12,611
And you are?

553
00:37:14,233 --> 00:37:16,073
Negasonic Teenage Warhead.

554
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:19,570
Negasonic Teenage... What the shit?

555
00:37:19,613 --> 00:37:21,363
That's the coolest name ever!

556
00:37:22,908 --> 00:37:25,538
So, what, you're like, his sidekick?

557
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:27,077
No. Trainee.

558
00:37:27,121 --> 00:37:28,581
Let me guess.

559
00:37:28,622 --> 00:37:31,122
X-Men left you behind on what? Shit detail?

560
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:32,286
What does that make you?

561
00:37:32,334 --> 00:37:34,754
Pretending you're not here, Negasonic Teenage Warhead.

562
00:37:34,795 --> 00:37:36,055
Can we trade names?

563
00:37:36,714 --> 00:37:37,714
Can we go?

564
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:40,126
Look! I'm a teenage girl.

565
00:37:40,175 --> 00:37:42,385
I'd rather be anywhere than here.

566
00:37:42,428 --> 00:37:44,638
I'm all about long sullen silences...

567
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:48,140
followed by mean comments, followed by more silences.

568
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:51,939
So what's it gonna be, huh? Long sullen silence...

569
00:37:51,979 --> 00:37:54,519
or mean comment? Go on.

570
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:57,074
You got me in a box here.

571
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:00,070
We can't allow this, Deadpool.

572
00:38:00,112 --> 00:38:01,572
Please, come quietly.

573
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:03,913
You big chrome cock-gobbler!

574
00:38:03,949 --> 00:38:04,949
That's not nice.

575
00:38:04,992 --> 00:38:06,592
You're really gonna fuck this up for me?

576
00:38:06,827 --> 00:38:11,247
Trust me, that wheezing bag of dick-tips has it coming.

577
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:13,830
He's pure evil.

578
00:38:14,209 --> 00:38:17,499
Besides... nobody's getting hurt.

579
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:25,101
That guy was already up there when I got here.

580
00:38:25,137 --> 00:38:28,307
Wade, you are better than this.

581
00:38:28,349 --> 00:38:31,849
- Join us. Use your powers for good. - Heads up.

582
00:38:31,894 --> 00:38:33,314
Be a superhero.

583
00:38:33,354 --> 00:38:34,274
Listen!

584
00:38:34,313 --> 00:38:36,673
The day I decide to become a crime-fighting shit-swizzler...

585
00:38:37,024 --> 00:38:40,114
who rooms with a bunch of other little whiners at the Neverland mansion...

586
00:38:40,152 --> 00:38:45,032
of some creepy, old, bald, Heaven's Gate-looking motherfucker...

587
00:38:45,074 --> 00:38:46,834
on that day...

588
00:38:47,076 --> 00:38:49,116
I'll send your shiny, happy ass a friend request.

589
00:38:49,161 --> 00:38:51,661
But until then, I'mma do what I came here to do.

590
00:38:51,705 --> 00:38:54,455
Either that or slap the bitch outta you!

591
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,750
- Wade... - Hey.

592
00:38:55,793 --> 00:38:57,003
Zip it, Sinéad!

593
00:38:57,044 --> 00:38:58,174
Hey, douche-pool!

594
00:38:58,212 --> 00:38:59,422
And I hope you're watching...

595
00:39:04,176 --> 00:39:05,926
Quite unfortunate.

596
00:39:09,306 --> 00:39:11,556
That does it!

597
00:39:15,938 --> 00:39:17,308
Canada!

598
00:39:18,607 --> 00:39:19,727
That's not good.

599
00:39:19,775 --> 00:39:20,865
Wade, please.

600
00:39:20,901 --> 00:39:21,901
Cock shot!

601
00:39:23,987 --> 00:39:25,527
Your poor wife.

602
00:39:25,572 --> 00:39:27,372
You really should stop.

603
00:39:30,953 --> 00:39:33,333
All the dinosaurs feared the T. rex.

604
00:39:38,002 --> 00:39:40,212
I promise this gets worse for you, big boy!

605
00:39:40,254 --> 00:39:41,424
This is embarrassing.

606
00:39:42,172 --> 00:39:43,972
Please, stay down.

607
00:39:45,092 --> 00:39:47,512
You ever hear of the one-legged man in the ass-kicking contest?

608
00:39:47,553 --> 00:39:49,013
Do you have off switch?

609
00:39:49,054 --> 00:39:51,854
Yeah, it's right next to the prostate. Or is that the on switch?

610
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:52,890
Enough!

611
00:40:02,526 --> 00:40:04,396
Let us go talk to the Professor.

612
00:40:04,903 --> 00:40:06,703
McAvoy or Stewart?

613
00:40:06,739 --> 00:40:08,949
These timelines are so confusing.

614
00:40:10,284 --> 00:40:12,954
Dead or alive, you're coming with me!

615
00:40:12,995 --> 00:40:14,545
You will recover, Wade.

616
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:16,460
You always do.

617
00:40:20,961 --> 00:40:24,381
You ever see 127 Hours? Spoiler alert.

618
00:40:28,135 --> 00:40:29,305
Oh, my God.

619
00:40:29,345 --> 00:40:30,395
Nasty.

620
00:40:33,515 --> 00:40:35,595
There's the money shot, baby.

621
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:38,020
Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.

622
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:51,367
Rock, meet bottom.

623
00:40:51,867 --> 00:40:54,867
And when life ends up breathtakingly fucked...

624
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:59,370
you can generally trace it back to one big, bad decision.

625
00:40:59,416 --> 00:41:02,666
The one that sent you down the road to Shitsburgh.

626
00:41:02,711 --> 00:41:05,761
This? Well, this was mine.

627
00:41:06,298 --> 00:41:07,758
Mr. Wilson.

628
00:41:09,134 --> 00:41:13,684
Nothing warms my heart more than a change of someone else's.

629
00:41:13,722 --> 00:41:15,432
You finally hit fuck it.

630
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,600
Just promise you'll do right by me.

631
00:41:19,269 --> 00:41:21,269
So I can do right by someone else.

632
00:41:21,313 --> 00:41:22,483
Of course.

633
00:41:23,232 --> 00:41:24,982
And please don't make the super-suit green.

634
00:41:26,276 --> 00:41:27,776
Or animated.

635
00:41:34,284 --> 00:41:37,334
Move it! Keep moving.

636
00:41:47,965 --> 00:41:50,095
This place seems sanitary.

637
00:41:50,843 --> 00:41:53,093
My first request is warmer hands.

638
00:41:53,637 --> 00:41:56,927
And, Jesus, a warmer table.

639
00:41:58,475 --> 00:42:00,435
We should really come up with a safe word, fellas.

640
00:42:00,686 --> 00:42:02,516
I'm thinking pork and beans.

641
00:42:06,817 --> 00:42:08,027
Easy.

642
00:42:10,029 --> 00:42:12,319
Aren't you a little strong for a lady?

643
00:42:13,115 --> 00:42:14,495
I'm calling wang.

644
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:19,620
What's up with the matches?

645
00:42:19,872 --> 00:42:22,622
Oral fixation or just a big Stallone fan?

646
00:42:24,168 --> 00:42:25,458
Patience, Angel.

647
00:42:26,378 --> 00:42:28,128
All in good time.

648
00:42:28,172 --> 00:42:30,092
Are you here for the turndown service, or what?

649
00:42:31,675 --> 00:42:32,925
We have another talker.

650
00:42:32,968 --> 00:42:34,798
I'm just excited about my first day at superhero camp.

651
00:42:34,845 --> 00:42:37,005
Shut the fuck up.

652
00:42:40,351 --> 00:42:42,311
Mr. Wilson, my name's Ajax.

653
00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:45,360
I manage this workshop.

654
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:49,730
My welcome speech used to be full of euphemisms like...

655
00:42:49,777 --> 00:42:53,407
This may hurt a little. This may cause you some discomfort.

656
00:42:53,447 --> 00:42:55,737
But I've grown blunt.

657
00:42:55,783 --> 00:42:58,413
This workshop is not a government-led program.

658
00:42:58,452 --> 00:43:02,122
It's a private institution that turns reclamation projects like yourself...

659
00:43:02,164 --> 00:43:05,504
into men of extraordinary abilities.

660
00:43:07,127 --> 00:43:10,377
But if you think superhuman powers are acquired painlessly...

661
00:43:11,298 --> 00:43:12,298
Wrong.

662
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:16,890
I'm injecting you with a serum that activates any mutant genes lurking in your DNA.

663
00:43:17,137 --> 00:43:21,057
For it to work we need to subject you to extreme stress.

664
00:43:26,522 --> 00:43:29,822
You've heard that whole make an omelet, break some eggs bit, right?

665
00:43:30,567 --> 00:43:31,987
I'm about to hurt you, Wade.

666
00:43:33,153 --> 00:43:35,703
I was a patient here once myself, you know.

667
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,740
The treatment affects everyone differently.

668
00:43:39,076 --> 00:43:41,906
It made Angel inhumanly strong.

669
00:43:42,246 --> 00:43:46,246
In my case, it enhanced my reflexes.

670
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:49,710
Also scorched my nerve endings, so I no longer feel pain.

671
00:43:51,422 --> 00:43:55,262
And, in fact, I no longer feel anything.

672
00:44:03,767 --> 00:44:06,557
Thanks! Thank you. Thank you.

673
00:44:06,854 --> 00:44:08,614
You have something in your teeth.

674
00:44:09,523 --> 00:44:11,733
Right in the middle there. Just, I don't...

675
00:44:11,775 --> 00:44:14,685
A little nugget of romaine lettuce or something.

676
00:44:16,697 --> 00:44:19,117
It's been bothering me for a long time.

677
00:44:20,576 --> 00:44:21,616
Made you look.

678
00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:25,370
Is Ajax your actual name? Because it sounds suspiciously made up.

679
00:44:25,414 --> 00:44:26,544
What is it really?

680
00:44:26,582 --> 00:44:29,002
Kevin? Bruce? Scott?

681
00:44:29,043 --> 00:44:30,633
Mitch? The Rickster?

682
00:44:31,295 --> 00:44:32,805
Is it Basil Fawlty?

683
00:44:33,130 --> 00:44:34,630
Joke away.

684
00:44:35,090 --> 00:44:37,970
One thing that never survives this place is a sense of humor.

685
00:44:38,469 --> 00:44:39,759
We'll see about that.

686
00:44:39,803 --> 00:44:41,143
I suppose we will.

687
00:44:42,473 --> 00:44:44,063
He's all yours.

688
00:44:44,099 --> 00:44:45,309
Come on.

689
00:44:45,809 --> 00:44:48,939
You're gonna leave me all alone here with less-angry Rosie O'Donnell?

690
00:44:53,317 --> 00:44:55,397
This is how it's going to work.

691
00:44:55,444 --> 00:44:58,454
Adrenaline acts as a catalyst for the serum...

692
00:44:59,073 --> 00:45:01,583
so we're going to have to make you suffer.

693
00:45:03,327 --> 00:45:08,157
If you're lucky, the mutant genes will activate and manifest in a spectacular fashion.

694
00:45:12,461 --> 00:45:15,301
If not, well, we'll have to keep on hurting you...

695
00:45:17,132 --> 00:45:19,842
in new and different ways, each more painful than the last...

696
00:45:22,513 --> 00:45:24,853
until you finally mutate.

697
00:45:26,475 --> 00:45:27,685
Or die.

698
00:45:34,525 --> 00:45:36,155
You mean like a bucket list?

699
00:45:36,193 --> 00:45:38,493
Like a fuck-it list.

700
00:45:38,529 --> 00:45:41,199
I'd really like to light a spliff off the Olympic torch.

701
00:45:41,782 --> 00:45:43,662
Pass it to me right after.

702
00:45:43,701 --> 00:45:49,661
Let's not forget naked tandem base-jumping with the WNBA's Sacramento Monarchs.

703
00:45:50,708 --> 00:45:53,838
Anything on my bucket list would involve public nudity.

704
00:45:54,336 --> 00:45:57,206
Finally, giving Meredith Baxter-Birney a Dutch oven.

705
00:45:57,506 --> 00:46:00,626
No. Receiving a Dutch oven from Meredith Baxter-Birney.

706
00:46:05,305 --> 00:46:08,725
Making banana pancakes for my kids.

707
00:46:12,146 --> 00:46:14,186
Vanessa.

708
00:46:17,693 --> 00:46:20,073
I wanna see Vanessa.

709
00:46:20,112 --> 00:46:21,532
You're lovely.

710
00:46:21,572 --> 00:46:24,992
I don't know about anyone else, but I'm touched.

711
00:46:25,034 --> 00:46:26,164
We were just joking.

712
00:46:26,201 --> 00:46:28,501
No, no. It's okay.

713
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:31,250
I encourage distractions.

714
00:46:31,999 --> 00:46:34,379
Wouldn't want you giving up on us, now would we?

715
00:46:34,418 --> 00:46:36,248
Hey, don't take any shit from him, Cunningham.

716
00:46:37,212 --> 00:46:39,592
How tough can he be...

717
00:46:39,631 --> 00:46:42,551
with a name like Francis?

718
00:46:43,135 --> 00:46:44,265
Francis?

719
00:46:44,553 --> 00:46:45,973
That's his legal name.

720
00:46:46,597 --> 00:46:50,057
He got Ajax from the dish soap.

721
00:46:52,102 --> 00:46:55,692
F-R-A-N-C-I...

722
00:46:56,190 --> 00:46:57,520
Oops!

723
00:46:59,318 --> 00:47:02,198
Snagged the dry cleaning tag off your lab coat.

724
00:47:04,114 --> 00:47:06,534
FYI, I could probably get you the superhero discount.

725
00:47:06,575 --> 00:47:07,985
You are so relentlessly annoying.

726
00:47:08,035 --> 00:47:09,085
Thanks.

727
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:10,369
Never heard that before.

728
00:47:10,412 --> 00:47:13,672
Why don't you do us all a favor and shut the fuck up?

729
00:47:13,707 --> 00:47:15,707
Or I'll sew your pretty mouth shut.

730
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:19,253
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

731
00:47:19,296 --> 00:47:22,546
See, here's the problem with round-the-clock torture...

732
00:47:22,591 --> 00:47:25,551
is that you can't really step it up from there.

733
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:30,520
Is that what you think?

734
00:47:35,813 --> 00:47:38,323
If this doesn't unlock your mutation, then, well...

735
00:47:39,149 --> 00:47:40,439
nothing will.

736
00:47:40,859 --> 00:47:43,859
Now, what we're going to do is lower the oxygen concentration in the air...

737
00:47:43,904 --> 00:47:46,534
to the exact point you feel like you're suffocating.

738
00:47:46,824 --> 00:47:49,994
If your brainwaves slow, meaning you're about to pass out...

739
00:47:50,661 --> 00:47:51,791
then we'll turn up the O2.

740
00:47:52,830 --> 00:47:54,250
If your heart rate slows...

741
00:47:54,289 --> 00:47:56,999
meaning you're able to catch your breath...

742
00:47:57,042 --> 00:47:58,422
we'll turn it back down.

743
00:47:59,044 --> 00:48:02,714
And that's where we'll leave you. Right there.

744
00:48:03,090 --> 00:48:05,380
And I thought you guys were dicks before.

745
00:48:05,426 --> 00:48:07,836
You know the funniest part of this?

746
00:48:08,595 --> 00:48:10,965
You still think we're making you a superhero.

747
00:48:11,807 --> 00:48:15,267
You. A dishonorable discharge.

748
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:18,060
Hip-deep in hookers.

749
00:48:18,772 --> 00:48:20,402
You're nothing.

750
00:48:21,358 --> 00:48:22,818
Little secret, Wade.

751
00:48:23,652 --> 00:48:27,742
This workshop doesn't make superheroes, we make super-slaves.

752
00:48:28,824 --> 00:48:32,584
We're gonna fit you with a control collar and auction you off to the highest bidder.

753
00:48:33,370 --> 00:48:34,890
Who knows what they'll have you doing?

754
00:48:35,581 --> 00:48:39,041
Terrorizing citizens, putting down freedom fighters.

755
00:48:41,211 --> 00:48:44,051
Maybe just mow the occasional lawn.

756
00:48:44,548 --> 00:48:47,008
What the fuck is wrong with you?

757
00:48:52,264 --> 00:48:55,104
You're never going home after this.

758
00:48:55,142 --> 00:48:57,352
Now there's a brave face.

759
00:48:58,395 --> 00:48:59,935
Wait, wait! Wait. Wait.

760
00:49:02,274 --> 00:49:06,194
Seriously, you actually have something in your teeth now.

761
00:49:08,113 --> 00:49:09,493
Enjoy your weekend.

762
00:49:09,865 --> 00:49:11,575
Weekend? Back up.

763
00:49:11,617 --> 00:49:12,827
Weekend?

764
00:49:54,535 --> 00:49:56,625
Did I say this was a love story?

765
00:49:56,662 --> 00:49:59,122
No, it's a horror movie.

766
00:50:15,597 --> 00:50:17,767
Fucking hell.

767
00:50:17,808 --> 00:50:21,058
Looks like someone lost his shot at Homecoming King.

768
00:50:21,103 --> 00:50:23,193
What have you done to me?

769
00:50:23,230 --> 00:50:26,610
I've merely raised your stress levels high enough to trigger a mutation.

770
00:50:26,650 --> 00:50:28,780
You sadistic fuck!

771
00:50:29,486 --> 00:50:30,986
I've cured you, Wade.

772
00:50:31,822 --> 00:50:33,462
Now your mutated cells can heal anything.

773
00:50:34,575 --> 00:50:37,335
It's attacking your cancer as fast as it can form.

774
00:50:38,579 --> 00:50:41,159
Yeah, I've seen similar side effects before.

775
00:50:42,458 --> 00:50:43,498
I could cure them...

776
00:50:47,087 --> 00:50:48,757
but where's the fun in that?

777
00:50:51,091 --> 00:50:53,641
Now, I'm gonna shut you in again, Wade.

778
00:50:55,429 --> 00:50:57,389
Not because I need to.

779
00:51:01,352 --> 00:51:03,062
Because I want to.

780
00:51:17,534 --> 00:51:18,744
Oh, well.

781
00:51:18,786 --> 00:51:19,996
Go ahead.

782
00:51:23,207 --> 00:51:25,037
You smell like shit.

783
00:51:28,337 --> 00:51:29,377
Motherfucker.

784
00:51:30,297 --> 00:51:32,217
It's all right, it's all right.

785
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:35,050
I think we owe him that one, yeah?

786
00:51:35,302 --> 00:51:37,682
You take off. Go on.

787
00:51:38,472 --> 00:51:39,812
Off you go.

788
00:51:50,818 --> 00:51:52,398
Quick question.

789
00:51:54,697 --> 00:51:56,737
What's my name?

790
00:52:02,496 --> 00:52:03,826
Didn't think so.

791
00:52:05,708 --> 00:52:08,418
Sorry, Francis. My lips are sealed.

792
00:54:04,868 --> 00:54:06,328
You don't want to kill me.

793
00:54:06,370 --> 00:54:08,620
I'm the only one who can fix your ugly mug.

794
00:55:05,346 --> 00:55:06,926
What's my name?

795
00:55:13,103 --> 00:55:14,273
Wade.

796
00:56:21,630 --> 00:56:24,670
I didn't just get the cure to el cáncer...

797
00:56:26,176 --> 00:56:28,846
I got the cure to el everything.

798
00:56:32,516 --> 00:56:34,766
But there was only one thing...

799
00:56:34,810 --> 00:56:36,440
that really mattered.

800
00:57:05,883 --> 00:57:06,933
Come on, let's go.

801
00:57:12,264 --> 00:57:15,024
Oh, that must hurt.

802
00:57:16,018 --> 00:57:17,478
Thank you so much.

803
00:57:29,406 --> 00:57:31,656
God, he's so fucking gnarly.

804
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:33,120
Look at his face.

805
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:35,540
Oh, my God. Poor guy.

806
00:57:35,579 --> 00:57:36,709
Honey, don't stare.

807
00:57:36,747 --> 00:57:37,907
Freak.

808
00:57:58,268 --> 00:58:01,608
No way. I'm not making her life as ugly as mine.

809
00:58:01,897 --> 00:58:04,437
Come on, Wade, it can't be that bad.

810
00:58:04,483 --> 00:58:05,823
Bullshit!

811
00:58:05,859 --> 00:58:09,109
I'm a monster inside and out. I belong in a fucking circus.

812
00:58:09,154 --> 00:58:11,704
Wade, Vanessa loves you. She doesn't care what you...

813
00:58:13,492 --> 00:58:14,492
Do you like what you see?

814
00:58:14,702 --> 00:58:15,872
No.

815
00:58:16,370 --> 00:58:20,330
You look like an avocado had sex with an older, more disgusting avocado.

816
00:58:20,749 --> 00:58:21,539
Yeah.

817
00:58:21,583 --> 00:58:23,673
Not gently. Like it was hate-fucking.

818
00:58:23,711 --> 00:58:25,631
There was something wrong with the relationship...

819
00:58:25,671 --> 00:58:29,301
and that was the only catharsis that they could find without violence.

820
00:58:29,341 --> 00:58:31,931
And the only guy who can fix this fugly mug...

821
00:58:31,969 --> 00:58:34,679
is the British shitstick who ran the mutant factory.

822
00:58:34,722 --> 00:58:36,642
And he's gone. Poof!

823
00:58:36,682 --> 00:58:38,392
Yeah, well you gotta do something to remedy this...

824
00:58:38,434 --> 00:58:41,484
because as of now, you only have one course of action.

825
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:42,770
Damn straight.

826
00:58:42,813 --> 00:58:44,693
- Find Francis. - Star in horror films.

827
00:58:44,732 --> 00:58:45,692
What?

828
00:58:45,733 --> 00:58:47,943
Star in your own horror films.

829
00:58:47,985 --> 00:58:51,825
Because you look like Freddy Krueger face-fucked a topographical map of Utah.

830
00:58:52,656 --> 00:58:54,406
Here's what I'm actually gonna do.

831
00:58:54,450 --> 00:58:57,120
I'm gonna work through his crew until somebody gives up Francis...

832
00:58:57,161 --> 00:58:59,541
force him to fix this, then put a bullet in his skull...

833
00:58:59,580 --> 00:59:01,250
and fuck the brain hole.

834
00:59:01,290 --> 00:59:04,420
I don't wanna see that or think of it again.

835
00:59:04,460 --> 00:59:06,670
But the douchebag does think you're dead, right?

836
00:59:06,712 --> 00:59:07,422
Yeah.

837
00:59:07,463 --> 00:59:09,343
That's good. You should keep it that way.

838
00:59:09,381 --> 00:59:11,051
What, like, wear a mask?

839
00:59:11,091 --> 00:59:14,051
Yes. A very thick mask. All the time.

840
00:59:14,803 --> 00:59:15,803
I am sorry...

841
00:59:15,846 --> 00:59:18,466
you are haunting.

842
00:59:18,515 --> 00:59:20,425
Your face is the stuff of nightmares.

843
00:59:20,476 --> 00:59:21,846
Like a testicle with teeth.

844
00:59:21,894 --> 00:59:23,654
You will die alone.

845
00:59:23,687 --> 00:59:25,307
I mean, if you could die.

846
00:59:25,939 --> 00:59:27,899
Ideally, for others' sake.

847
00:59:27,941 --> 00:59:29,191
That'll do.

848
00:59:29,485 --> 00:59:31,285
All you need now is a suit and a nickname...

849
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:33,200
like Wade the Wisecracker...

850
00:59:33,614 --> 00:59:36,744
or Scaredevil, Mr. Neverdie.

851
00:59:37,618 --> 00:59:38,618
Shit.

852
00:59:39,203 --> 00:59:40,293
What?

853
00:59:41,121 --> 00:59:43,121
I put all my money on you and now...

854
00:59:43,165 --> 00:59:44,755
I just realized I'm never gonna win the...

855
00:59:44,792 --> 00:59:45,792
Dead pool.

856
00:59:49,672 --> 00:59:51,972
Captain Deadpool.

857
00:59:53,842 --> 00:59:54,972
No, just...

858
00:59:55,010 --> 00:59:56,760
- Just Deadpool, yeah. - Just Deadpool.

859
00:59:56,804 --> 00:59:58,764
To you, Mr. Pool.

860
00:59:59,056 --> 01:00:01,556
Deadpool. That sounds like a fucking franchise.

861
01:00:16,156 --> 01:00:18,236
This shit's gonna have nuts in it.

862
01:00:19,326 --> 01:00:20,326
Where's Francis?

863
01:00:34,591 --> 01:00:36,261
Where's Francis?

864
01:00:44,435 --> 01:00:46,355
Seltzer water and lemon for blood.

865
01:00:47,688 --> 01:00:50,608
Or wear red. Dumbass.

866
01:01:09,335 --> 01:01:10,795
Don't make me ask twice.

867
01:01:12,171 --> 01:01:13,551
Where...

868
01:01:13,589 --> 01:01:15,719
is Francis?

869
01:01:16,300 --> 01:01:18,010
He made me ask twice.

870
01:01:18,052 --> 01:01:20,052
Is the mask muffling my voice?

871
01:01:24,850 --> 01:01:26,310
Where's Francis?

872
01:01:28,937 --> 01:01:30,767
Where the fuck is Francis?

873
01:01:39,448 --> 01:01:42,828
You're about to be killed by a Zamboni.

874
01:01:42,868 --> 01:01:44,078
Where's Francis?

875
01:01:45,496 --> 01:01:46,616
No! Please!

876
01:01:47,247 --> 01:01:50,707
Oh, God! I'm so sorry!

877
01:01:51,251 --> 01:01:53,881
You little spider monkey!

878
01:01:56,965 --> 01:02:00,425
Where... is... Francis?

879
01:02:01,595 --> 01:02:02,845
This is confusing.

880
01:02:02,888 --> 01:02:05,848
Is it sexist to hit you? Is it more sexist to not hit you?

881
01:02:05,891 --> 01:02:08,191
I mean, the line gets real... blurry.

882
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:10,480
WHERE IS FRANCIS?

883
01:02:12,064 --> 01:02:15,324
Tell me where your fucking boss is or you're gonna die!

884
01:02:15,943 --> 01:02:17,573
In five minutes!

885
01:02:27,705 --> 01:02:29,465
Don't hesitate to call me.

886
01:02:45,097 --> 01:02:47,267
Nice to see you, Jared.

887
01:02:48,434 --> 01:02:49,894
I'll take the footlong...

888
01:02:50,394 --> 01:02:51,394
fully loaded.

889
01:03:06,827 --> 01:03:08,447
41 confirmed kills.

890
01:03:08,495 --> 01:03:10,905
Now it's 89. About to be 90.

891
01:03:11,665 --> 01:03:12,955
Mr. Wilson?

892
01:03:14,752 --> 01:03:16,922
You're looking very alive.

893
01:03:17,755 --> 01:03:18,805
Only on the outside.

894
01:03:19,465 --> 01:03:22,385
- This is not going to end well for me, is it? - This is not gonna end well for you, no.

895
01:03:22,426 --> 01:03:23,586
Where's your boss?

896
01:03:23,635 --> 01:03:25,255
I can tell you exactly...

897
01:03:26,972 --> 01:03:28,852
Oh, you'll tell me, but first...

898
01:03:29,433 --> 01:03:31,733
You might wanna look away for this.

899
01:03:31,769 --> 01:03:33,049
Now this little piggy went to...

900
01:03:35,147 --> 01:03:37,437
Thank you, Agent Smith.

901
01:03:41,028 --> 01:03:42,028
Taxi!

902
01:03:43,530 --> 01:03:45,780
Hop in! Great day for a ride.

903
01:03:47,785 --> 01:03:49,225
And we all know how this turned out.

904
01:03:52,122 --> 01:03:54,332
Whoops! You weren't meant to see that.

905
01:04:02,299 --> 01:04:04,129
There. All caught up.

906
01:04:12,059 --> 01:04:13,979
We're here.

907
01:04:14,895 --> 01:04:17,975
Sorry about bleeding in all your garbage.

908
01:04:24,238 --> 01:04:26,318
Seltzer water and lemon for blood.

909
01:04:28,492 --> 01:04:31,042
Some kinds of anger can't be managed...

910
01:04:31,078 --> 01:04:36,168
like the kind where your year-long plan ends with the wrong guy getting dismembered!

911
01:04:36,834 --> 01:04:41,344
That said, when it comes time to licking wounds, there's no place like home.

912
01:04:42,172 --> 01:04:46,432
And I share that home with someone you've met, the old blind lady from the laundromat, Al.

913
01:04:46,844 --> 01:04:48,394
God, I miss cocaine.

914
01:04:49,013 --> 01:04:50,013
Her.

915
01:04:50,848 --> 01:04:53,428
Fourth-wall break inside a fourth-wall break.

916
01:04:53,684 --> 01:04:56,234
That's like 16 walls.

917
01:04:56,770 --> 01:05:02,190
She's like Robin to my Batman, except she's old, and black, and blind.

918
01:05:02,234 --> 01:05:03,904
And I think she's in love with me.

919
01:05:04,361 --> 01:05:07,741
Wait, pretty sure Robin loves Batman, too.

920
01:05:17,750 --> 01:05:18,750
Al?

921
01:05:21,170 --> 01:05:22,420
Morning, sleepyhead.

922
01:05:24,048 --> 01:05:26,218
It smells like old lady pants in here.

923
01:05:26,258 --> 01:05:28,218
Yes, I'm old. I wear pants.

924
01:05:28,260 --> 01:05:29,850
But you're no lady.

925
01:05:31,013 --> 01:05:32,683
So comfy.

926
01:05:33,432 --> 01:05:36,482
Upside of being blind: I've never seen you in Crocs.

927
01:05:36,518 --> 01:05:38,018
You mean my big, rubber masturbating shoes?

928
01:05:38,062 --> 01:05:39,062
Yes, I know.

929
01:05:39,563 --> 01:05:42,233
Downside of being blind...

930
01:05:42,274 --> 01:05:44,444
I hear everything in this duplex.

931
01:05:46,779 --> 01:05:48,029
Sit on a stick.

932
01:05:48,072 --> 01:05:49,072
Bactin?

933
01:05:49,114 --> 01:05:53,204
Yeah. Bactin should do it.

934
01:05:54,411 --> 01:05:58,251
How's that Kullen coming along? IKEA doesn't assemble itself, you know.

935
01:05:58,290 --> 01:06:01,250
You're telling me. I don't mind the Kullen.

936
01:06:01,293 --> 01:06:03,173
It's an improvement on the Hurdal.

937
01:06:03,837 --> 01:06:06,457
Please. Anything's an improvement over the Hurdal.

938
01:06:06,507 --> 01:06:10,007
I'd have taken an Hemnes or a Trysil over the Hurdal.

939
01:06:11,136 --> 01:06:13,426
No, I didn't get excited till I saw the Kullen.

940
01:06:13,764 --> 01:06:14,644
Screw, please.

941
01:06:14,682 --> 01:06:16,062
Here? Now? Just kidding.

942
01:06:16,100 --> 01:06:17,310
I know it's been decades.

943
01:06:17,351 --> 01:06:18,481
You'd be surprised.

944
01:06:19,186 --> 01:06:20,266
Pretty grossed out.

945
01:06:22,272 --> 01:06:24,692
Ta... Da.

946
01:06:30,489 --> 01:06:33,619
I wish I never heard of Craigslist.

947
01:06:34,034 --> 01:06:36,664
And I quote, Looking for roommate, blind to life's imperfections.

948
01:06:36,704 --> 01:06:37,834
Must be good with hands.

949
01:06:37,871 --> 01:06:40,121
Or would you rather I build the IKEA, and you pay rent?

950
01:06:40,165 --> 01:06:42,035
Why such a douche this morning?

951
01:06:42,793 --> 01:06:43,923
Let's recap.

952
01:06:43,961 --> 01:06:46,301
The cock thistle that turned me into this freak...

953
01:06:46,338 --> 01:06:47,958
slipped through my arms today...

954
01:06:49,633 --> 01:06:50,843
Arm.

955
01:06:51,301 --> 01:06:54,431
Catching him was my only chance to be hot again, get my super sexy ex back...

956
01:06:54,471 --> 01:06:56,771
and prevent this shit from happening to someone else.

957
01:06:56,807 --> 01:07:00,557
So, yeah, today was about as much fun as a sandpaper dildo.

958
01:07:02,479 --> 01:07:04,019
#driveby.

959
01:07:21,498 --> 01:07:23,498
Found out who our friend in the red suit is.

960
01:07:25,836 --> 01:07:27,706
Fucking Wade Wilson.

961
01:07:28,672 --> 01:07:31,012
Suppose I'd wear a mask, too if I had a face like that.

962
01:07:31,675 --> 01:07:33,215
I only wish I healed the same.

963
01:07:37,181 --> 01:07:39,981
Still, we'll put him out of our misery.

964
01:07:40,017 --> 01:07:41,267
On our terms.

965
01:07:41,685 --> 01:07:43,435
Right. And when he heals?

966
01:07:44,438 --> 01:07:45,558
He can't.

967
01:07:45,606 --> 01:07:48,186
Not if there's nothing left of him to heal.

968
01:07:48,233 --> 01:07:52,203
You know, it's funny. I almost miss the fucker.

969
01:07:53,614 --> 01:07:55,034
I like a challenge.

970
01:07:56,367 --> 01:07:58,537
But he's bad for business.

971
01:07:58,577 --> 01:08:00,287
Now let's go find him.

972
01:08:04,750 --> 01:08:06,170
Tylenol PM?

973
01:08:06,210 --> 01:08:08,710
You can stick that where you stuck the Bactin.

974
01:08:09,129 --> 01:08:11,549
I raided my stash of wisdom tooth Percocet...

975
01:08:11,590 --> 01:08:15,550
and I am orbiting fucking Saturn right now.

976
01:08:18,389 --> 01:08:20,469
But I appreciate the gesture.

977
01:08:21,392 --> 01:08:25,852
Am I crazy, or is your hand really small?

978
01:08:25,896 --> 01:08:27,646
About the size of a KFC spork.

979
01:08:29,817 --> 01:08:32,027
I get why you're so pissy...

980
01:08:32,069 --> 01:08:35,069
but your mood's never gonna brighten till you find this woman...

981
01:08:35,114 --> 01:08:36,534
and tell her how you feel.

982
01:08:36,573 --> 01:08:39,953
What do I keep telling you, Mrs. Magoo? She wouldn't have me.

983
01:08:39,993 --> 01:08:41,703
If you could see me, you'd understand.

984
01:08:41,745 --> 01:08:42,865
Looks aren't everything.

985
01:08:42,913 --> 01:08:44,043
Looks are everything.

986
01:08:44,081 --> 01:08:46,211
You ever heard David Beckham speak?

987
01:08:46,250 --> 01:08:48,250
It's like he mouth-sexed a can of helium.

988
01:08:48,669 --> 01:08:51,919
Think Ryan Reynolds got this far on his superior acting method?

989
01:08:51,964 --> 01:08:53,384
Love is blind, Wade.

990
01:08:53,424 --> 01:08:54,424
No.

991
01:08:55,426 --> 01:08:56,676
You're blind.

992
01:08:57,344 --> 01:09:00,264
So, you're just gonna lie there and whimper?

993
01:09:00,305 --> 01:09:02,385
No, I'm gonna wait till this arm plows through puberty...

994
01:09:02,433 --> 01:09:04,913
and then I'm gonna come up with a whole new Christmas Day plan.

995
01:09:05,352 --> 01:09:08,022
In the meantime, you might wanna leave the room.

996
01:09:08,689 --> 01:09:11,109
I bet it feels huge in this hand.

997
01:09:12,443 --> 01:09:15,153
Go, go, go.

998
01:09:15,696 --> 01:09:18,656
So, the doctor says, The bad news is you don't have that long to live.

999
01:09:18,699 --> 01:09:20,279
So, the patient says, How long do I have?

1000
01:09:20,325 --> 01:09:22,235
The doctor says, Five.

1001
01:09:22,286 --> 01:09:23,906
The guy says, Five what?

1002
01:09:23,954 --> 01:09:27,834
The doctor says, Four, three, two...

1003
01:09:35,007 --> 01:09:36,547
Can I help you ladies?

1004
01:09:39,136 --> 01:09:40,296
I do hope so.

1005
01:09:44,516 --> 01:09:48,646
I heard you might be able to point me in the direction of a friend of mine.

1006
01:09:49,188 --> 01:09:50,188
Name of Wade Wilson.

1007
01:09:51,732 --> 01:09:52,862
Sorry.

1008
01:09:52,900 --> 01:09:54,480
I don't know the name.

1009
01:10:01,825 --> 01:10:04,155
Hey, you're not supposed to be behind the bar.

1010
01:10:07,873 --> 01:10:09,793
I've seen this girl.

1011
01:10:09,833 --> 01:10:12,343
This must be Vanessa. I've heard so much about you.

1012
01:10:17,091 --> 01:10:18,841
Sweetheart, you might wanna look around.

1013
01:10:19,426 --> 01:10:22,006
This isn't really the place to do something like that.

1014
01:10:23,430 --> 01:10:25,180
Easy, Angel.

1015
01:10:25,224 --> 01:10:26,604
Put the little man down.

1016
01:10:28,185 --> 01:10:29,935
We have everything we need now.

1017
01:10:30,354 --> 01:10:31,404
You sure?

1018
01:10:32,106 --> 01:10:35,186
You don't want any clothes that are not monochromatic?

1019
01:10:35,234 --> 01:10:37,904
Have fun at your midnight showing of Blade II.

1020
01:10:41,573 --> 01:10:43,283
Thanks for having my back, guys.

1021
01:10:48,288 --> 01:10:52,578
Wade, we have a fucking problem. And by we, I mean you.

1022
01:10:53,460 --> 01:10:55,130
I can't believe I'm doing this.

1023
01:10:55,629 --> 01:10:58,509
Is there a word for half afraid, half angry?

1024
01:10:58,549 --> 01:11:00,679
Yeah, afrangry, I guess.

1025
01:11:00,718 --> 01:11:02,518
Have you decided what you're gonna say to her?

1026
01:11:02,553 --> 01:11:03,553
Fuck me!

1027
01:11:03,887 --> 01:11:05,807
Maybe not start with that.

1028
01:11:11,729 --> 01:11:15,019
Hey, coming onto our stage right now...

1029
01:11:15,065 --> 01:11:17,225
give it up for Chastity!

1030
01:11:21,071 --> 01:11:23,411
Or as I like to call her, Irony.

1031
01:11:23,449 --> 01:11:25,579
Better find her fast before numbnuts does.

1032
01:11:25,617 --> 01:11:27,117
How do you know she's in here?

1033
01:11:27,161 --> 01:11:30,291
Because I'm constantly stalking that fox.

1034
01:11:55,272 --> 01:11:58,782
Every time I see her, it's like the first time...

1035
01:11:59,610 --> 01:12:01,780
Especially from this angle.

1036
01:12:25,302 --> 01:12:29,312
You can't buy love, but you can rent it for three minutes.

1037
01:12:32,351 --> 01:12:35,021
You weak motherfucker!

1038
01:12:35,813 --> 01:12:36,813
Come on!

1039
01:12:38,023 --> 01:12:41,323
Come on, get it together. This isn't about me, this is about Vanessa.

1040
01:12:45,489 --> 01:12:46,819
Here we go.

1041
01:12:49,410 --> 01:12:50,990
Maximum effort.

1042
01:12:54,540 --> 01:12:55,670
Vanessa.

1043
01:12:58,168 --> 01:13:02,338
Someone out back asking for you. Something about an old boyfriend.

1044
01:13:29,700 --> 01:13:30,780
I knew it was you.

1045
01:13:32,619 --> 01:13:34,539
The weird, curvy edges.

1046
01:13:36,123 --> 01:13:37,963
Like a jigsaw puzzle.

1047
01:13:48,052 --> 01:13:49,892
You have Wade Wilson to thank for this.

1048
01:13:58,896 --> 01:14:00,436
Hey. Hey! Where'd she go?

1049
01:14:01,398 --> 01:14:03,938
I saw her head to the back. Go get her, tiger.

1050
01:14:31,970 --> 01:14:33,720
Motherfucker!

1051
01:14:33,764 --> 01:14:36,104
- Wait, wait. Let's... Just... - Cock juggling...

1052
01:14:36,141 --> 01:14:38,061
- We can talk about what we're gonna... - Jiminy! Fuck face!

1053
01:14:38,102 --> 01:14:39,392
Okay, or you can hit that.

1054
01:14:39,436 --> 01:14:41,266
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Fuck! Fuck!

1055
01:14:41,313 --> 01:14:43,983
- No, no. All right. Hey! - Fuck! Fuck!

1056
01:14:44,441 --> 01:14:45,481
- Fuck! - Hey.

1057
01:14:46,527 --> 01:14:48,607
Relax. Relax. Okay.

1058
01:14:48,654 --> 01:14:49,994
Okay. I think that's a good start.

1059
01:14:50,030 --> 01:14:52,120
I'm gonna rip his motherfucking...

1060
01:14:52,157 --> 01:14:53,157
Wait.

1061
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:54,700
- Find it! Find it. - What?

1062
01:14:54,743 --> 01:14:56,343
- I'm gonna get angry. - Okay. All right.

1063
01:14:56,578 --> 01:14:58,368
All right. Okay. All right.

1064
01:14:58,414 --> 01:14:59,754
Here. This is Vanessa.

1065
01:14:59,790 --> 01:15:01,830
- What? - No, wait. It's Francis.

1066
01:15:01,875 --> 01:15:03,495
He wants you to come to him.

1067
01:15:03,794 --> 01:15:05,964
- What is that? - That's the shit emoji.

1068
01:15:06,338 --> 01:15:08,468
You know, it's the turd with the smiling face and the eyes?

1069
01:15:08,507 --> 01:15:10,837
I thought it was chocolate yogurt for so long.

1070
01:15:11,552 --> 01:15:12,762
I need guns.

1071
01:15:12,803 --> 01:15:13,973
Okay, which ones?

1072
01:15:14,013 --> 01:15:15,143
I need all the guns!

1073
01:15:15,180 --> 01:15:16,390
All right. Okay.

1074
01:15:37,077 --> 01:15:38,537
That's about 3,000 rounds.

1075
01:15:39,496 --> 01:15:41,536
We all know what I can do with 12.

1076
01:15:41,957 --> 01:15:44,167
Hey, hey, careful with that, Ronnie Milsap!

1077
01:15:44,209 --> 01:15:45,289
We're downrange.

1078
01:15:46,754 --> 01:15:50,304
I was gonna spend the night assembling the Börje, but this is holding my interest.

1079
01:15:51,467 --> 01:15:54,297
I told you, we're going with the Urvaj, not the Börje.

1080
01:15:54,345 --> 01:15:56,355
Get it through your head or get out of fuck town.

1081
01:15:56,388 --> 01:15:59,178
Shit. That's all the pieces in the house.

1082
01:15:59,224 --> 01:16:00,984
Nah. Come on. Let's go. Cough it up.

1083
01:16:01,352 --> 01:16:02,852
Up, up, up.

1084
01:16:04,271 --> 01:16:05,401
Down, down, down.

1085
01:16:05,439 --> 01:16:06,439
Fuck you.

1086
01:16:08,275 --> 01:16:10,985
.45 cal. I like it.

1087
01:16:13,155 --> 01:16:14,415
Wade...

1088
01:16:15,616 --> 01:16:18,326
I'd go with you, but I don't want to.

1089
01:16:22,873 --> 01:16:24,043
Listen, Al...

1090
01:16:25,125 --> 01:16:30,295
if I never see you again, I want you to know that I love you very much.

1091
01:16:31,215 --> 01:16:36,345
And also, there's about 116 kilos of cocaine buried somewhere in the apartment...

1092
01:16:36,387 --> 01:16:39,177
right next to the cure for blindness. Good luck.

1093
01:16:44,687 --> 01:16:45,977
You wanna get fucked up?

1094
01:16:56,073 --> 01:16:57,573
Put her down over here.

1095
01:17:07,793 --> 01:17:09,003
Go on then.

1096
01:17:11,422 --> 01:17:14,012
Thanks, dickless. And I mean you.

1097
01:17:14,466 --> 01:17:17,796
Wow. You're a talker too. You and Wade.

1098
01:17:17,845 --> 01:17:21,105
I've been trying to tell you assholes, you've got the wrong girl.

1099
01:17:21,140 --> 01:17:22,680
My old boyfriend, he's dead.

1100
01:17:22,725 --> 01:17:26,395
See, I thought that too. But he keeps on coming back.

1101
01:17:26,437 --> 01:17:27,767
Like a cockroach...

1102
01:17:27,813 --> 01:17:29,113
but uglier.

1103
01:17:30,149 --> 01:17:33,609
Now, I may not feel, but he does.

1104
01:17:34,695 --> 01:17:36,735
Let's see how he fights with your head on the block.

1105
01:17:45,497 --> 01:17:46,997
Ripley, from Alien 3!

1106
01:17:47,624 --> 01:17:49,464
Fuck, you're old.

1107
01:17:51,128 --> 01:17:53,588
Fake laugh. Hiding real pain.

1108
01:17:53,630 --> 01:17:55,010
Go get Silver Balls.

1109
01:17:55,049 --> 01:17:57,299
You guys going for a bite? Early bird special?

1110
01:17:57,343 --> 01:18:00,183
Like there's something wrong with eating before sundown or saving money.

1111
01:18:00,304 --> 01:18:03,644
No, you know that bad guy that you let go?

1112
01:18:04,224 --> 01:18:06,144
He's got my girl.

1113
01:18:06,185 --> 01:18:07,565
You're gonna help me get her back.

1114
01:18:07,978 --> 01:18:09,808
Wade? Is that you?

1115
01:18:09,855 --> 01:18:14,275
Yeah, it's me, Deadpool, and I got an offer that you can't refuse.

1116
01:18:16,987 --> 01:18:18,147
I'm gonna wait out here, okay?

1117
01:18:18,197 --> 01:18:20,277
It's a big house. It's funny that I only ever see two of you.

1118
01:18:20,324 --> 01:18:23,624
It's almost like the studio couldn't afford another X-Man.

1119
01:18:27,164 --> 01:18:28,624
And that is why, in my opinion...

1120
01:18:28,665 --> 01:18:31,875
the movie Cocoon is pure pornography.

1121
01:18:32,378 --> 01:18:34,168
Who brought this twinkly man?

1122
01:18:34,213 --> 01:18:36,303
Twinkly, but deadly.

1123
01:18:36,340 --> 01:18:40,390
My chrome-penised friend back there has agreed to do me this solid.

1124
01:18:40,969 --> 01:18:44,969
In exchange, I said that I would consider joining his boy band.

1125
01:18:45,015 --> 01:18:46,305
It's not boy band.

1126
01:18:46,350 --> 01:18:47,390
Sure it's not.

1127
01:18:48,727 --> 01:18:50,397
So, any luck winning Gita back?

1128
01:18:51,188 --> 01:18:53,648
I tried to hold on tight, Mr. Pool...

1129
01:18:53,691 --> 01:18:57,321
but Bandhu is more craftier and handsomer than me.

1130
01:18:57,986 --> 01:18:59,696
Well, I think you're pretty darn cute.

1131
01:19:05,577 --> 01:19:06,577
Dopinder?

1132
01:19:08,539 --> 01:19:09,539
What was that?

1133
01:19:11,583 --> 01:19:17,213
That was Bandhu in the trunk.

1134
01:19:17,881 --> 01:19:19,171
Ban who?

1135
01:19:19,216 --> 01:19:22,006
My romantic rival Bandhu. He's tied up in the trunk.

1136
01:19:22,052 --> 01:19:23,722
I'm doing as you said, DP.

1137
01:19:23,762 --> 01:19:27,562
I plan to gut him like a tandoori fish, then dump his carcass on Gita's doorstep.

1138
01:19:28,892 --> 01:19:30,562
I did not tell him to do that.

1139
01:19:30,602 --> 01:19:33,312
Absolutely not. It got lost in translation.

1140
01:19:33,355 --> 01:19:36,565
Dopinder, this is no way to win Gita's heart back!

1141
01:19:36,608 --> 01:19:37,728
I'm so proud of you.

1142
01:19:37,776 --> 01:19:40,066
Drop Bandhu off, safe and gentle-like.

1143
01:19:40,112 --> 01:19:41,032
Kill him.

1144
01:19:41,071 --> 01:19:43,201
And then, win Gita back...

1145
01:19:43,240 --> 01:19:46,030
the old fashioned way: with your boyish charm.

1146
01:19:46,076 --> 01:19:47,406
Kidnap her.

1147
01:19:48,954 --> 01:19:50,124
He's super dead.

1148
01:19:55,586 --> 01:19:57,206
I presume a crisp high five?

1149
01:19:57,254 --> 01:19:58,594
For you? 10.

1150
01:20:00,090 --> 01:20:02,880
Okay, guys, let's get out there and make a difference.

1151
01:20:02,926 --> 01:20:04,796
You know what to do.

1152
01:20:05,763 --> 01:20:08,393
Knock 'em dead, Pool Boy!

1153
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:11,600
Time to make the chimi-fuckin'-changas.

1154
01:20:13,103 --> 01:20:14,733
Not often a dude ruins your face...

1155
01:20:14,772 --> 01:20:17,732
skull-stomps your sanity, grabs your future baby mama...

1156
01:20:17,775 --> 01:20:21,955
and personally sees to four of your five shittiest moments.

1157
01:20:21,987 --> 01:20:26,157
Let's just say, it's beginning to look a lot like Christmas.

1158
01:20:39,129 --> 01:20:40,459
Hey.

1159
01:20:40,506 --> 01:20:41,796
Where's your duffle bag?

1160
01:21:00,651 --> 01:21:02,071
Bandhu?

1161
01:21:03,612 --> 01:21:05,742
Leave a message and have a happy day.

1162
01:21:05,781 --> 01:21:07,121
God damn it!

1163
01:21:07,157 --> 01:21:08,867
I'm gonna do this the old fashioned way...

1164
01:21:08,909 --> 01:21:12,329
with two swords and maximum effort.

1165
01:21:13,330 --> 01:21:14,330
Cue the music.

1166
01:21:30,514 --> 01:21:32,974
Wade Wilson!

1167
01:21:33,517 --> 01:21:35,137
What's my name?

1168
01:21:35,769 --> 01:21:37,349
I'mma fuckin' spell it out for ya.

1169
01:21:39,690 --> 01:21:40,770
Go get some.

1170
01:21:40,816 --> 01:21:41,976
Superhero landing.

1171
01:21:42,026 --> 01:21:44,026
She's gonna do a superhero landing. Wait for it.

1172
01:21:48,657 --> 01:21:49,817
Superhero landing!

1173
01:21:50,367 --> 01:21:51,447
You know, that's really hard on your knees.

1174
01:21:51,785 --> 01:21:53,225
Totally impractical. They all do it.

1175
01:21:53,704 --> 01:21:57,004
You're a lovely lady, but I'm saving myself for Francis.

1176
01:21:57,041 --> 01:21:58,251
That's why I brought him.

1177
01:21:58,292 --> 01:22:01,502
I prefer not to hit a woman, so please...

1178
01:22:08,719 --> 01:22:11,809
I mean, that's why I brought her?

1179
01:22:13,349 --> 01:22:15,519
Oh, no, finish your tweet. It's not... That's...

1180
01:22:15,559 --> 01:22:17,139
Just give us a second. Yeah.

1181
01:22:17,186 --> 01:22:18,516
There you go. Hashtag it.

1182
01:22:19,897 --> 01:22:21,727
Go get her, tiger.

1183
01:22:28,405 --> 01:22:32,155
I so pity the dude who pressures her into prom sex.

1184
01:22:32,868 --> 01:22:34,408
All right, then. Fire!

1185
01:22:46,173 --> 01:22:47,803
Finish fucking her the fuck up!

1186
01:22:47,841 --> 01:22:48,881
Language, please.

1187
01:22:48,926 --> 01:22:50,086
Suck a cock.

1188
01:23:16,120 --> 01:23:17,790
Look away, child.

1189
01:23:18,539 --> 01:23:19,869
Look away!

1190
01:23:27,214 --> 01:23:28,554
Wait!

1191
01:23:28,590 --> 01:23:29,760
Wait!

1192
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:30,800
Cease fire!

1193
01:23:30,843 --> 01:23:32,183
Cease fire!

1194
01:23:32,219 --> 01:23:33,679
Fellas! Hey! Hey!

1195
01:23:35,055 --> 01:23:38,765
You only work for that shit-spackled muppet fart.

1196
01:23:38,809 --> 01:23:42,849
So, I'mma give you a chance for y'all to lay down your firearms...

1197
01:23:42,896 --> 01:23:45,896
in exchange for preferential, bordering on gentle...

1198
01:23:45,941 --> 01:23:49,401
possibly even lover-like treatment.

1199
01:23:51,447 --> 01:23:52,737
Fine.

1200
01:23:52,781 --> 01:23:53,781
Commando!

1201
01:25:05,896 --> 01:25:06,896
Teabag!

1202
01:25:11,402 --> 01:25:12,402
Bob?

1203
01:25:13,445 --> 01:25:14,395
Wade?

1204
01:25:14,446 --> 01:25:15,736
Oh, my God, I haven't seen you since...

1205
01:25:15,781 --> 01:25:18,071
- Jacksonville. Fridays. - Since TGI Fridays.

1206
01:25:18,867 --> 01:25:20,577
Well, what the hell!

1207
01:25:21,161 --> 01:25:22,661
God, come here, you.

1208
01:25:24,832 --> 01:25:26,792
How are the kids? Good?

1209
01:25:27,334 --> 01:25:29,254
And Gail? She's still fixing that tuna casserole?

1210
01:25:29,294 --> 01:25:32,094
So good! But bad for the waistline, if you know what I'm talking about.

1211
01:25:38,804 --> 01:25:42,144
Your... On the left. You are beautiful woman.

1212
01:25:42,182 --> 01:25:43,232
That is so sweet.

1213
01:25:44,685 --> 01:25:45,685
Thanks.

1214
01:25:57,865 --> 01:26:01,455
Does he write you notes too? He's such a romantic.

1215
01:26:01,827 --> 01:26:03,197
Don't worry, baby. I'm comin'.

1216
01:26:04,830 --> 01:26:05,830
Fire!

1217
01:26:13,213 --> 01:26:14,673
Hey!

1218
01:26:15,007 --> 01:26:16,007
Climb on!

1219
01:26:53,003 --> 01:26:54,553
Motherfucking...

1220
01:27:05,933 --> 01:27:08,393
Motherfucker should have worn his brown pants.

1221
01:27:11,188 --> 01:27:12,358
You were right, beautiful.

1222
01:27:13,232 --> 01:27:14,942
Red really is my color.

1223
01:27:15,859 --> 01:27:16,819
Wade?

1224
01:27:16,860 --> 01:27:17,860
Don't worry, baby...

1225
01:27:18,195 --> 01:27:20,195
I'mma get you out of that shit-box.

1226
01:27:20,698 --> 01:27:22,908
What better way to crawl back inside that head of yours?

1227
01:27:22,950 --> 01:27:24,870
Oh, you never left.

1228
01:27:24,910 --> 01:27:27,040
But you did, asshole!

1229
01:27:27,079 --> 01:27:28,539
Deep breath, darling.

1230
01:27:30,082 --> 01:27:31,212
Oh, wait.

1231
01:27:32,334 --> 01:27:33,884
Wrong choice of words.

1232
01:27:36,088 --> 01:27:38,968
I hope they blocked pain to your every last nerve.

1233
01:27:39,008 --> 01:27:40,088
'Cause I'mma go lookin'!

1234
01:27:41,510 --> 01:27:43,550
I hear you grow back body parts now, Wade.

1235
01:27:44,054 --> 01:27:45,054
When I'm finished...

1236
01:27:45,180 --> 01:27:47,020
parts will have to grow back you.

1237
01:27:47,057 --> 01:27:48,177
Good one.

1238
01:27:49,101 --> 01:27:51,021
Yep, that was a good one.

1239
01:27:51,061 --> 01:27:52,061
Let's dance.

1240
01:27:53,397 --> 01:27:54,647
And by dance, I mean...

1241
01:27:54,690 --> 01:27:55,850
let's try to kill each other.

1242
01:28:50,454 --> 01:28:52,664
Fine. Fists.

1243
01:28:52,956 --> 01:28:54,786
Sounds like your last Saturday night.

1244
01:30:16,707 --> 01:30:18,787
Asshole!

1245
01:31:15,140 --> 01:31:16,140
Hang in there, baby!

1246
01:31:16,642 --> 01:31:18,602
- Wade! - I gotcha!

1247
01:31:22,022 --> 01:31:23,982
I got a plan. You're not gonna like it.

1248
01:31:34,618 --> 01:31:35,738
Shit! Shit! Shit!

1249
01:31:41,709 --> 01:31:44,209
Don't worry. I'm totally on top of this.

1250
01:32:00,227 --> 01:32:01,307
Damn it!

1251
01:32:02,229 --> 01:32:05,109
Maximum effort!

1252
01:32:47,441 --> 01:32:48,441
Thanks.

1253
01:32:53,364 --> 01:32:55,034
Just take it slow.

1254
01:33:05,459 --> 01:33:08,089
Oh, my God! That was so...

1255
01:33:39,118 --> 01:33:40,698
There are no words!

1256
01:33:41,745 --> 01:33:45,365
Me and you are headed to fix this butterface.

1257
01:33:46,125 --> 01:33:47,135
What?

1258
01:33:49,670 --> 01:33:52,380
You stupid fucking idiot.

1259
01:33:52,923 --> 01:33:57,473
Did you really think there was a cure... for that?

1260
01:33:59,388 --> 01:34:00,388
What?

1261
01:34:00,764 --> 01:34:01,854
You heard me.

1262
01:34:03,642 --> 01:34:04,812
No.

1263
01:34:04,852 --> 01:34:06,102
No!

1264
01:34:13,277 --> 01:34:16,277
So, you mean to say...

1265
01:34:17,072 --> 01:34:21,332
after all this, you can't fix me?

1266
01:34:21,910 --> 01:34:24,040
It sounds even stupider when you say it.

1267
01:34:24,079 --> 01:34:29,169
Like the kind of stupid who admits he can't do the one thing I'm keeping him alive for?

1268
01:34:33,005 --> 01:34:34,845
Any last words?

1269
01:34:36,717 --> 01:34:37,797
What's my name?

1270
01:34:38,927 --> 01:34:40,217
Who fucking cares?

1271
01:34:40,262 --> 01:34:41,262
Wade!

1272
01:34:42,681 --> 01:34:45,061
Four or five moments.

1273
01:34:45,642 --> 01:34:46,642
I'm sorry?

1274
01:34:46,685 --> 01:34:49,055
Four or five moments, that's all it takes.

1275
01:34:49,772 --> 01:34:50,772
To?

1276
01:34:51,815 --> 01:34:53,145
Be a hero.

1277
01:34:55,152 --> 01:34:57,902
Everyone thinks it's a full-time job.

1278
01:34:57,946 --> 01:35:01,526
Wake up a hero, brush your teeth a hero, go to work a hero.

1279
01:35:02,326 --> 01:35:04,116
Not true.

1280
01:35:04,161 --> 01:35:09,331
Over a lifetime, there are only four or five moments that really matter.

1281
01:35:09,708 --> 01:35:12,208
Moments when you're offered a choice.

1282
01:35:12,252 --> 01:35:16,422
To make a sacrifice, conquer a flaw, save a friend...

1283
01:35:17,216 --> 01:35:19,836
spare an enemy.

1284
01:35:20,260 --> 01:35:21,640
In these moments...

1285
01:35:22,429 --> 01:35:25,309
everything else falls away.

1286
01:35:26,016 --> 01:35:28,556
The way the world sees us.

1287
01:35:28,936 --> 01:35:29,936
The way we...

1288
01:35:34,191 --> 01:35:35,191
Why?

1289
01:35:36,443 --> 01:35:38,493
You were droning on.

1290
01:35:38,529 --> 01:35:41,569
Sure, I may be stuck looking like pepperoni flatbread...

1291
01:35:41,615 --> 01:35:44,405
but at least fuckface won't heal from that.

1292
01:35:44,660 --> 01:35:47,290
If wearing superhero tights...

1293
01:35:47,746 --> 01:35:49,206
means sparing psychopaths...

1294
01:35:49,248 --> 01:35:51,418
then maybe I wasn't meant to wear 'em.

1295
01:35:51,458 --> 01:35:53,918
Not everyone monitors a hall like you.

1296
01:35:53,961 --> 01:35:55,131
Just promise...

1297
01:35:55,170 --> 01:35:58,920
Yeah, yeah, I'll be on the lookout for the next four moments.

1298
01:35:58,966 --> 01:36:00,586
Oh, shit.

1299
01:36:00,634 --> 01:36:06,604
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm just a boy, about to stand in front of a girl...

1300
01:36:06,640 --> 01:36:07,970
and tell her...

1301
01:36:08,017 --> 01:36:10,097
What the fuck am I gonna tell her?

1302
01:36:10,144 --> 01:36:13,404
Well, you better figure it out.

1303
01:36:14,857 --> 01:36:16,147
I can't even tell you...

1304
01:36:16,191 --> 01:36:17,281
I deserved that. That, too.

1305
01:36:18,027 --> 01:36:19,777
No, no, no, maybe not the nethers.

1306
01:36:19,820 --> 01:36:21,610
Start talking!

1307
01:36:23,657 --> 01:36:25,237
I'm sorry.

1308
01:36:25,492 --> 01:36:26,952
I'm so sorry.

1309
01:36:27,786 --> 01:36:30,326
For everything, I'm sorry for leaving...

1310
01:36:31,832 --> 01:36:33,922
I'm sorry for not cowboying up sooner.

1311
01:36:33,959 --> 01:36:36,039
It's been rough couple of years.

1312
01:36:36,086 --> 01:36:37,086
Rough?

1313
01:36:44,553 --> 01:36:46,393
I live in a crackhouse.

1314
01:36:47,639 --> 01:36:48,969
With a family of 12.

1315
01:36:50,726 --> 01:36:52,266
Every night we spoon for warmth.

1316
01:36:52,311 --> 01:36:55,361
Everybody fights for Noelle. She's the fattest.

1317
01:36:55,397 --> 01:37:01,237
There's nothing that we don't share. Floor space, dental floss, even condoms.

1318
01:37:09,370 --> 01:37:11,540
So, you live in a house.

1319
01:37:20,381 --> 01:37:23,341
I should have come and found you sooner.

1320
01:37:24,802 --> 01:37:28,762
But, baby, the guy under this mask, he ain't the same one that you remember.

1321
01:37:33,143 --> 01:37:34,353
You mean this mask?

1322
01:37:54,498 --> 01:37:56,078
And this one.

1323
01:37:57,543 --> 01:37:59,343
In case the other fell off.

1324
01:38:02,297 --> 01:38:04,587
All right. Yeah, just...

1325
01:38:04,633 --> 01:38:06,343
Like a Band-Aid, just give it a...

1326
01:38:06,385 --> 01:38:08,605
Owdie 5,000.

1327
01:38:08,637 --> 01:38:09,637
Wait, wait, wait...

1328
01:38:11,557 --> 01:38:12,807
Are you sure?

1329
01:38:14,685 --> 01:38:15,695
I'm sure.

1330
01:38:26,196 --> 01:38:27,196
Wow.

1331
01:38:28,449 --> 01:38:29,569
Yeah.

1332
01:38:36,498 --> 01:38:37,828
Hey...

1333
01:38:40,085 --> 01:38:41,835
After a brief adjustment period...

1334
01:38:42,379 --> 01:38:44,299
and a bunch of drinks...

1335
01:38:45,716 --> 01:38:47,676
it's a face...

1336
01:38:52,139 --> 01:38:53,769
I'd be happy to sit on.

1337
01:39:01,231 --> 01:39:04,941
I'm not the same underneath this suit, either.

1338
01:39:04,985 --> 01:39:05,985
No.

1339
01:39:06,320 --> 01:39:08,280
Super-penis.

1340
01:39:08,322 --> 01:39:10,202
Come on, Wade. Language.

1341
01:39:10,449 --> 01:39:11,829
Young one is present.

1342
01:39:12,910 --> 01:39:14,790
What are you still doing?

1343
01:39:14,828 --> 01:39:17,538
Get out of here. Go make yourself useful!

1344
01:39:17,581 --> 01:39:20,381
You, go be a really big brother to someone.

1345
01:39:20,417 --> 01:39:22,167
Tell Beast to stop shitting on my lawn.

1346
01:39:22,211 --> 01:39:24,171
And you, chicken noodle...

1347
01:39:24,213 --> 01:39:26,013
nothing compares to you.

1348
01:39:26,048 --> 01:39:28,128
Sinéad O'Connor, 1990. Sorry.

1349
01:39:28,175 --> 01:39:30,885
That's all right. You're cool.

1350
01:39:32,805 --> 01:39:34,515
What in the ass?

1351
01:39:34,556 --> 01:39:37,596
That was not mean! I'm proud of you!

1352
01:39:38,018 --> 01:39:41,188
We will make an X-Man of you yet, Wade.

1353
01:39:41,230 --> 01:39:44,360
For a second there, it felt like we were three mini-lion robots...

1354
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:46,610
coming together to form one super robot.

1355
01:39:47,486 --> 01:39:48,696
There's a stupid.

1356
01:39:48,737 --> 01:39:49,777
Yeah.

1357
01:39:53,242 --> 01:39:57,622
And now, for the moment I've all been waiting for.

1358
01:40:01,375 --> 01:40:02,505
Come here.

1359
01:40:12,386 --> 01:40:15,346
Wham! As promised.

1360
01:40:28,402 --> 01:40:29,572
See?

1361
01:40:29,611 --> 01:40:33,201
You don't need to be a superhero to get the girl.

1362
01:40:33,240 --> 01:40:36,120
The right girl will bring out the hero in you.

1363
01:40:36,618 --> 01:40:40,118
Now, let's finish this epic wide shot. Pull out.

1364
01:40:40,164 --> 01:40:41,754
There we go, that looks nice.

1365
01:40:41,790 --> 01:40:44,170
That's gonna be about the only thing that's pulling out tonight.

1366
01:40:44,209 --> 01:40:47,589
Who doesn't love a happy ending, huh?

1367
01:40:47,629 --> 01:40:51,469
Till next time, this is your friendly neighborhood pool guy singing...

1368
01:40:51,508 --> 01:40:57,388
I'm never gonna dance again the way I danced with you

1369
01:47:07,343 --> 01:47:08,893
You're still here?

1370
01:47:11,513 --> 01:47:14,563
It's over. Go home.

1371
01:47:16,226 --> 01:47:20,556
You're expecting a teaser for Deadpool 2. Well, we don't have that kind of money.

1372
01:47:21,607 --> 01:47:24,647
What are you expecting? Sam Jackson to show up?

1373
01:47:24,693 --> 01:47:27,363
With an eye patch and a saucy little leather number?

1374
01:47:27,404 --> 01:47:29,034
Go. Go.

1375
01:47:35,287 --> 01:47:37,827
But I can tell you one thing, and it's a bit of a secret.

1376
01:47:37,873 --> 01:47:41,083
For the sequel, we're gonna have Cable.

1377
01:47:41,126 --> 01:47:43,546
Amazing character. Bionic arm, time travel.

1378
01:47:43,587 --> 01:47:45,877
We have no idea who we're gonna cast yet, but it could be anybody.

1379
01:47:45,923 --> 01:47:49,223
Just need a big guy with a flat top. Could be Mel Gibson, Dolph Lundgren...

1380
01:47:49,259 --> 01:47:51,759
Keira Knightley. She's got range. Who knows.

1381
01:47:51,804 --> 01:47:53,224
Anyway, big secret.

1382
01:47:53,263 --> 01:47:57,773
And don't leave your garbage all lying around. It's a total dick move.

1383
01:47:58,727 --> 01:48:06,727
Go.
