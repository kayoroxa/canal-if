1
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,120
Survival of the fittest.

2
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:14,280
It is the law of the jungle.

3
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:17,240
There is always someone trying to take away what is yours.

4
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:19,520
How do I know?

5
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,170
I almost passed me.

6
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,310
Tim Templeton...

7
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:40,750
Cease from monkeying around

8
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:42,620
The hot dogs are cooling

9
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:43,980
 dogs?

10
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:46,040
At least I remember.

11
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:47,510
Very good friend is lunchtime.

12
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,230
I was seven ...

13
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:52,310
and at that age, one depends on your imagination.

14
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:01,910


15
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:03,070
Our heroe!

16
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:04,290
Relax, Mom and Dad.

17
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:05,340
I got this!

18
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,880
HOT SAUCE

19
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:11,340


20
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,890
Sometimes I rescued my parents.

21
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:19,210
Over there!

22
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,780
Other times, they me.

23
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:23,740
- I lose control!  - Tim, look out!

24
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,680
Tree!

25
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:27,680
I can not hear you well!

26
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:28,980
Slow down, Tim!

27
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,310
- Gira, Tim!  - Turn!

28
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:33,390
- You got hurt?  - I'm fine.

29
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:34,740
See those teeth.

30
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:36,450
There were only three.

31
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,010
Los Templeton.

32
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,330
And three is the perfect number.

33
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:41,620
Interesting fact.

34
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:44,360
The triangle is the strongest shape in nature.

35
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:52,940
It was the luckiest kid in the world.

36
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,130
My parents had a great job!

37
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:58,120
Company working for the world's largest pet:

38
00:01:58,390 --> 00:01:59,390
PerriCorp.

39
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:01,230
- Yes, Mr. Francis.  - PerriCorp you need.

40
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:02,490
It is time to act.

41
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,930
Working in an area called Marketing ...

42
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:08,260
in throwing new products.

43
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:15,010
Although my parents worked very hard ...

44
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:18,730
always they reserved enough for me.

45
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:21,690
Three stories, five hugs and my special song, okay?

46
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:22,930
Done deal.

47
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,230
Blackbird singing in the dead of night

48
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:31,830
Take these broken wings and learn to fly

49
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:34,300
All your life

50
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:39,160
Only expect this moment to take flight

51
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:46,760
Hey, Tim, how about having a little brother?

52
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:49,930
No thanks.  So I'm fine.

53
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:56,050
Life was good.  It was perfect.

54
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:57,780
But go falling asleep ...

55
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:00,890
something my parents said made me think.

56
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,390
Where do babies come from?

57
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:18,820


58
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:58,840


59
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:29,850
FAMILY

60
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:31,910
FAMILY

61
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,560
FAMILY

62
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,100
FAMILY

63
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:46,820
MANAGEMENT

64
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,300
WELCOME TO MANAGEMENT

65
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:26,050
A HEAD IN DIAPERS

66
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:42,570
The day he arrived my brother began like any other ...

67
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:45,300
but I did not imagine ...

68
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,350
that my life would never be the same.

69
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:51,180
Wake up, shorty!  They are 7 am

70
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,920
Wake up, shorty!

71
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:54,000
Good day, Maguin!

72
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,690
What great adventure is waiting for you today?

73
00:05:58,530 --> 00:05:59,530
Yes!

74
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:05,880
My parents always said I had a very active imagination.

75
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,100
But I remember clearly ...

76
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,710
the baby came to us in a taxi.

77
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:32,410
What?

78
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:38,590
Â¡Oye!

79
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:59,150
Tim, look who came!

80
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:06,300
Say hello to your new baby.

81
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,610
To me what?

82
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:11,110
Little brother.

83
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,010
I had a million questions.

84
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:14,890
Who is that guy?  What is he doing here?

85
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,240
Why the suit?

86
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:18,600
Why are you so fat?  Why do I look like?

87
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,560
Do you know karate?  What's going on?

88
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,330
Over there?

89
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:24,570
- Good.  - Good.

90
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:26,170
From the beginning, she is yelling at everyone ...

91
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,880
He gave them orders.

92
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,560
You want this?

93
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,440
Something was obvious.  He was the boss.

94
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:37,300
Shamelessly he puts his office in the middle of the house.

95
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:39,730
He organized together.

96
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,620
- Called?  - Want to Mr. Squeaky?

97
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:46,080
Many, many boards.

98
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:47,890
Even in the middle of the night.

99
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,180
I woke up, I woke up!

100
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:52,680
- We're coming!  - It did not take!

101
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:56,180
If things were not done to your satisfaction ... immediately

102
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,690
He had a tantrum.

103
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,780
- What about the bottle?  - Give him his bottle!

104
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,740
Had everyone eating out of his pudgy hands.

105
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:15,180
Everyone except me.

106
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,560
- Nappy!  - Bottle!

107
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,050
- Nappy!  - Bottle!

108
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,100
Dad, I can not sleep!

109
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:21,770
Already.  Me neither.

110
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,080
The baby needs a lot of attention now.

111
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,300
OK, good bye.

112
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:26,570
- But ... - Quiet.

113
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,040
Daddy is here.  Daddy is here.

114
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,300
What about me?

115
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:34,670
Year: 2057.

116
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:39,210
The alferes T-Rex and I investigated a hostile alien invasion.

117
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:04,360
It's much worse than we thought.

118
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,850
Mom, is naked!

119
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,020
I'm naked!

120
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,260
Say "naked".

121
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:21,470
Â¡No!

122
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:27,670
Who is the baby Mommy?  You're the baby Mommy?

123
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:30,060
No, it's the burly dad, right?

124
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,680
One of us should go to the convention pets.

125
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,150
In Las Vegas.

126
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:37,470
- You know what?  See you.  - No no.  See you.

127
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:38,670
You need a break.

128
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:41,060
- I'll take the baby and you ... - Let the baby decide.

129
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:44,730
Who do you want to stay with you?  Is Dad or Mom?

130
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,120
Â¿A papi?

131
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:47,760
He loves his mom.

132
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,590
Well, we need to talk!

133
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,880
In private.

134
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,310
- Clear.  - On what, champ?

135
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:56,450
Sobre el B-E-B-Ã‰-S.

136
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,350
Without "that", Tim.

137
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:00,280
That came out of nowhere!

138
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:01,530
Do not we know it!

139
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:02,840
We can not trust him.

140
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:04,760
Calma, is just a baby.

141
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,760
Really?  Am I the only one here who thinks that guy has something weird?

142
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,960
- Oh, I got it.  - Still serves.

143
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:23,410
Â¿Tim?

144
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:26,670
Look at him!  Bring a suit!

145
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,560
I know, is not a tenderness?  It's like a little man.

146
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,710
Always carrying a briefcase!

147
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,570
Would anyone else you think?

148
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:36,020
I do not know, a little strange?

149
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,650
You were wearing a Borreguita everywhere.

150
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,240
Borreguita has nothing to do!

151
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,550
Every baby is different, Tim.

152
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,100
And each one is special.

153
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,940
It is is taking over the whole house!

154
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:49,490
You're taking over the house?

155
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,360
Of course.  Of course.

156
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,060
Believe me, one day know better this little ...

157
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,800
and then you're going to want with all my heart.

158
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,060
Like us.

159
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:00,620
With all my heart?

160
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:07,590
Never.

161
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,280
Hello!

162
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:29,950
It's time for my three stories, hugs and five special song!

163
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:38,120
How about a story?

164
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:41,440
Three hugs and my special song?

165
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:48,250
Is it only my special song?

166
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,710
Mom?

167
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,540
Dad?

168
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:56,800
Hey.

169
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:58,750
Do not they're going to wrap?

170
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:01,990
On Monday I give Mr. Francis!

171
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,040
Do not Cry!  Do not Cry...

172
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,320
Hello?

173
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,120
Hello?  No, ma'am yet.

174
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,490
No, not excuses.

175
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:26,420
Yes ma'am, I know you've been here a long time.

176
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,890
Believe me, I feel as if carrying a lifetime.

177
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:37,970
I'm already making progress with parents.

178
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,340
The usual procedure: sleep deprivation, hunger strikes.

179
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,340
They are very confused.

180
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:46,840
I have them eating out of my hand.

181
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:49,310
They do everything for me.

182
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,560
It's hilarious.

183
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,390
But I think the boy suspected something.

184
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,240
No. I got this.

185
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:57,740
I know how important this mission for the company.

186
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,050
Mission?

187
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:02,070
Believe me, lady, I'm the baby for the job.

188
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,620
Hands up, evil baby!

189
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,920
Â¡Gas!  Â¡Butts!  Â¡Caca!

190
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,930
I deal with the NI-N-O.

191
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:11,150
You can talk!

192
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,820
No, really talk.  I heard you!

193
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,910
All right.  I can talk.

194
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:20,330
Let's see if you listen.

195
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:21,790
Get me a double espresso ...

196
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:23,600
and looking for a good sushi place nearby.

197
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,860
Would kill for a spicy tuna roll.

198
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,590
And buy something for you.

199
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:30,240
Who you are?

200
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:34,030
Let's just say I'm the boss.

201
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,430
The boss?  You're a baby!  Diaper use.

202
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:39,330
You know who else wears a diaper?

203
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:41,840
Astronauts and racing drivers.

204
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:43,350
It is efficient, Templeton.

205
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:47,160
The average child spends about 45 hours a year on the potty.

206
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:50,830
I'm the boss.  I do not have much free time.

207
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:52,530
Well, you're not my boss.

208
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,710
- Yeah I'm your boss.  - Do not.

209
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:56,070
- yes.  - Not.

210
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,380
- Yes!  - Not!

211
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:59,100
- yes.  - Not!

212
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,380
- yes.  - Not!

213
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:01,640
Yes.  Yes.

214
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:03,030
Yes.  Yes.

215
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:04,230
I arrived first.

216
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:06,410
Wait for Mom and Dad to know.

217
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:08,910
Oh yeah?  Do you think you would choose instead of me?

218
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,610
With your history?

219
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,280
You dont know nothing about me.

220
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:16,400
Yea that you want, right?  Let's see.

221
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,080
Templeton, Timothy.  Second name...

222
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:21,870
I am sorry.

223
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:22,980
Â¡Leslie!

224
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,720
- mediocre grades.  - How you know too much?

225
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:26,890
Can not you ride a bike without training wheels?

226
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:31,150
Even the bears know how to ride a bike without training wheels, Leslie.

227
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,100
You have 7 years.

228
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:34,390
Seven and a half.

229
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,420
Nap!  What were you saying?

230
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,940
I have seven and a half years.

231
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,620
Exact!  You are old.

232
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:44,780
It is time to make way for the next generation.

233
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,100
So the world works.

234
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,520
you would not ask your parents an old toy.

235
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,600
Â¿Borreguita?

236
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,840
Everyone wants the fashion.

237
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,500
Destroys.  Destroys.

238
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:55,120
- Borreguita!  - I have new batteries.

239
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:56,370
Â¡Five!

240
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:58,010
Mom and Dad did not even know you.

241
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,570
They worship Me!

242
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:01,090
Oh yeah?  You have the account, child.

243
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:03,720
There is a limited amount of love.

244
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,720
It's how are you accounts.

245
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:08,350
You used to have all the love of your parents.

246
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,720
All your time.  All his attention.

247
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,920
You were all accounts.

248
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,670
But then I came along.

249
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:16,720
Babies require a lot of time.

250
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:20,320
They need much attention.  They receive all the love.

251
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,140
We could share.

252
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:24,590
Obviously you not studied Economics.

253
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:31,680
Look, Templeton, do not give numbers.

254
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,020
There is not enough love for both.

255
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:36,370
Not enough accounts.

256
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:40,230
And suddenly, there is no room for Tim.

257
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:41,860
Tim no longer fits.

258
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,410
Oh no!  And Tim?

259
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:51,060
So silence.  Get out of my way.

260
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:53,040
Or there will be downsizing.

261
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:57,420
They can not fire you from your own family.

262
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,110
Or if?

263
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:26,180
Wake up, shorty!  They are 7 am

264
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:27,530
Awake, Dwarf ...!

265
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,210
For what?

266
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:33,380
Stand up for a nutritious breakfast!

267
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:35,030
They are 7 am

268
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,100
What happens, Timothy?

269
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:46,360
Does that made you sad little man?

270
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:50,500
I'll throw a curse on him!

271
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,910
It wont happen!

272
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,530
No case, Maguin.

273
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:56,500
He has deceived mom and dad.

274
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:59,620
If they knew what I know, would not let him stay.

275
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:03,520
Maybe your parents will need to open your eyes.

276
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:05,780
With a great curse!

277
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,090
Not pass!

278
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,140
Yes. Should I open their eyes ...

279
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,500
With proof!

280
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,220
That I need evidence!

281
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,500
Reveal your dark magic!

282
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,400
Testing testing.

283
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,900
Testing testing.

284
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,530
Maybe they can return it!

285
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:31,080
And their money back.

286
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,650
We can buy an inflatable house!

287
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:37,210
Good luck, Tim!  They are 8:45 am

288
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Ninja.

289
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:48,260
Ninja.

290
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:01,490
Ninja.

291
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:10,300
Ninja.

292
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:28,620
Babies everywhere!  They spread.

293
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:31,380
Mom!  Dad!  What's going on?

294
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,530
It's an invasion!

295
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:39,100
It's game day!

296
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:42,640
What a good photo.

297
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,590
It is a meeting, and you're not going to attend.

298
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:48,050
Come on.

299
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:54,570
We'll see.

300
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,180
Thank you for coming on such short notice.

301
00:18:58,430 --> 00:18:59,540
Well, before you start ...

302
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,390
CHILD IS LISTENING?

303
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:02,550
Yes sir!

304
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:03,690
- Clear!  - Affirmative!

305
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:05,650
Jimbo, generates interference.

306
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:08,290
Â¡Oye!

307
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:11,000
- Babies are in crisis!  - Oh no!

308
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:12,260
- That bad!  - What a horror!

309
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:13,450
What's going on?

310
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:16,250
It is easier to demonstrate them.  Teddy, please.

311
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:18,100
We will give a show!

312
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:21,420
Here we go!

313
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,850
Jimbo, lights.

314
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,680
You see, no longer babies receive as much love as before.

315
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:29,640
Why?  Do we misbehave?

316
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,960
No, Staci.

317
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,660
But I tell you who yes.

318
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,110
Here is our mortal enemy.  The puppies!

319
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,560
Do not!  That's the problem.

320
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,170
The puppies?  What is going on with them?

321
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,600
Along the history...

322
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,770
people have babies loved more than anything in the world.

323
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:49,560
We have always been indispensable ...

324
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:51,900
number one on any wish list.

325
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:55,140
The cubs were pure accessories.

326
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:59,790
But everything changed when the puppies started to leave ...

327
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:01,960
with new design models.

328
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:04,820
Each lovelier than the last.

329
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:06,690
You remember the labradoodle?

330
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:07,980
Does the peekapoo?

331
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:11,150
Does the chiweenie?  Try to speak without smiling.

332
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,760
Impossible.  Do not waste your time.

333
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:15,630
We all laughed shar pei.

334
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,430
And now the number one in China.

335
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:19,910
- Oh no!  - How terrible!

336
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:21,800
- Horrendous!  - Yes.

337
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:23,260
And things get worse.

338
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,160
Francis Francis, director of Perricorp, gave this announcement.

339
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:28,700
Teddy, running video.

340
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,920
Everything goes in a while ...

341
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,360
to present the most adorable puppy ever.

342
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:38,490
Whatever launch at the convention in Las Vegas pet!

343
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:39,940
Attention, Planet!

344
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:42,580
It will sweep away the competition!

345
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:44,730
- How good!  - No, Jimbo.

346
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:47,050
Nothing of "how well"!  We are the competition!

347
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:48,600
This is war.

348
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:51,090
Puppies are winning, we are losing babies.

349
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,280
Thank you, Teddy.

350
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,450
And if the new puppy is so cute as we fear ...

351
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:57,200
It could be the end of the baby business.

352
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,340
That bad!

353
00:20:58,490 --> 00:20:59,490
Bad news!

354
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:00,830
What are we going to do?

355
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,350
My job is to figure out what ...

356
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,150
to BebÃ©Corp can stop it.

357
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:06,650
And you will help me.

358
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:07,820
- Genius!  - tops!

359
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,740
You're still the best, boss!

360
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,800
How good!

361
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:10,550
How good.

362
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,600
Well, all parents work in PerriCorp.

363
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:14,840
Have you learned something from them?

364
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:16,410
- Yes sir!  - Clear!

365
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:17,610
Great.  What, Triplets?

366
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:18,580
- A - B.

367
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:19,690
- C. - D.

368
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:22,010
No, what have you learned about the new puppy?

369
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,360
Yes, puppy!

370
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:25,170
No, Jumbo!  Puppies are bad.

371
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:26,610
Staci, read the notes.

372
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,400
I do not know how to read.  What does it say?

373
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,360
This is my team?

374
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:37,230
A burly, a lot of activists and doodler?

375
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,440
- Exactly!  - Affirmative!

376
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:39,300
Well said.

377
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,340
- Yes!  - Good, BB!

378
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,400
I have you!

379
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:45,640
Leave that cookie.  They are for those serving missions.

380
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:47,340
- We want another show!  - No, Teddy.  Do not.

381
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:49,170
- A hug?  - No more shows!

382
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:49,960
Boss?

383
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:52,600
- There is enough love.  - Go to sleep!

384
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:53,860
Goodnight.

385
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,920
- Boss!  - Boss!

386
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,020
- What?  - Parents!

387
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:59,620
It's like they have a small board.

388
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:06,780
- Is not it adorable?  - Who wants dessert?

389
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:09,040
Heavens, how humiliating.

390
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:11,790
Heavens, how humiliating.

391
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,470
Wait for mom and dad to hear this.

392
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:17,340
Hey, Templeton, what have you got there?

393
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:20,430
Nothing.

394
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:21,910
Give me that tape.

395
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,280
Never!

396
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,440
Mom!  Dad!  Here!

397
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,740
- Hey, Timmy!  - Hello!  Anyway...

398
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,520
Flower Power!

399
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:46,020
You can not escape the law, bobo.

400
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,430
Put the belt.  Let's move on!

401
00:22:58,250 --> 00:22:59,250
Run Run Run.

402
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,020
What?  Hears!

403
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:14,130
Run Run Run.

404
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:15,840
Catch, catch, catch.

405
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:23,370
Yes!

406
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,380
How good!

407
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:34,490
Let me go, small ...

408
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,760
Look!  At last the children get along.

409
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:38,270
How good.

410
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,320
Â¡ Sayonara!

411
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,680
They want to play?

412
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,360
Let's play.

413
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:08,000
Â¡No!

414
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:11,330
Rescue the Boss!  Rescue the Boss!

415
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:15,030
- Get him!  - I am going!

416
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:16,210
- I am going!  - I am going!

417
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:24,450
You're fried, Mr. Baby!

418
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:26,590
Â¡Upa, upa!

419
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:31,730
Who wants...?

420
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:32,910
Cheese sticks!

421
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:39,160
Mom Dad!  I have evidence!

422
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:47,740
Can not you go downstairs?

423
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:51,130
Nothing can stop me!

424
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,400
Mom!  Dad!  Where are they?

425
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:04,620
Hello?

426
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:05,990
Where have all gone?

427
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:09,010
Mom Dad!  The baby can talk!

428
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:10,910
Do not tell me.

429
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:12,280
Wait, how ...?

430
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,660
Give me that tape.  Timmy.

431
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:15,350
O Borreguita get hurt, do you see?

432
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:17,290
Â¡No!

433
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:19,550
What do you say, Borreguita?  You want a nose ring?

434
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:22,600
Not my style, but who am I to judge?

435
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:26,690
And one eyebrow?  I think too, Borreguita.

436
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,210
How you will look at a job interview?

437
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:30,180
Â¡Basta!

438
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,220
The recording, Timmy!  Or I will pe-da-zos.

439
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:33,510
Do not!  Let her go!

440
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:34,930
- Let her go you!  - Let her go you!

441
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,270
- Tape!  - Give me a Borreguita!

442
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,270
Oops!  Too far.

443
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,320
Templeton!  Be reasonable.

444
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,420
We can be reasonable, right?  What do you do?

445
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,510
You'd have you wanted since you arrived!

446
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:49,500
We can drink a little juices and speak!

447
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,170
It happened when the little juices.

448
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,560
No, Templeton.  You would not dare.

449
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:55,980
Adiosito, baby!  You are fired!

450
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:57,010
What do you do?

451
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:58,070
Nothing.

452
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:03,250
My evidence!

453
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:04,930
Tim!  I want an explanation!

454
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:06,270
Yes, an explanation.

455
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:08,020
I did not go!  It's the fault of the baby.

456
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:09,380
Blame the baby?

457
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,290
It is true!  You can speak.

458
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:14,030
Everyone can speak.  They have a meeting.

459
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,400
They say something about puppies.

460
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:17,620
It's a conspiracy of babies!

461
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:19,510
Â¡Timothy Leslie Templeton!

462
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:21,100
We are very disappointed.

463
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:23,620
- No, we're upset with you!  - Yes, annoying.

464
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:25,390
- Annoying?  - You need a punishment!

465
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:27,250
- You're punished!  - Yes, punished!

466
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:28,610
- Two Three!

467
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:29,740
- Three days?  - Weeks!

468
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,950
Weeks!  Three weeks!

469
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:33,040
Three eternities!

470
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:33,950
Â¿Punished?

471
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:36,770
You're staying at home with your little brother ...

472
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:39,380
until they learn to get along.

473
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:41,710
Genial.

474
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:46,770
It was my first time behind bars.

475
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,550
Prison.

476
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:50,100
The confinement.

477
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:52,400
Punished for life.

478
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:56,500
The minutes turned into hours, hours into days.

479
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,450
Everyone has their breaking point.

480
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:00,560
This was mine.

481
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:05,050
The blackbird sings silent night

482
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:09,320
- Take these broken wings and learn to fly.  - Hey, that's my song.

483
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:12,350
All your life

484
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:17,290
Only expect this moment to take flight

485
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,740
Not for nothing, dwarf.

486
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:22,620
Maybe I can help.

487
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:27,170
The blackbird singing in the dead of night!

488
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:31,690
Please, you take these broken wings and learn to fly!

489
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:33,360
Fly, you fools!

490
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:34,730
Thank you, Maguin.

491
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:37,050
But it's not the same.

492
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:39,790
If only I could reach my magic knife.

493
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:42,640
We could escape from this prison.

494
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,330
Â¡Templeton!

495
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,150
Templeton, we must speak.

496
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:57,450
Get out of here.

497
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:06,060
Blackbird singing in the dead of night

498
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:09,010
Â¡Basta!

499
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:10,570
It's my song, not yours.

500
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:12,520
My parents wrote just for me.

501
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:15,000
Really?  Your parents are Lennon and McCartney?

502
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:17,320
No, Ted and Janice.

503
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:18,870
I do not even know their names!

504
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:20,620
RobÃ¡rmelos try.

505
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,920
You stole everything!

506
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:23,730
You should be in jail!

507
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:27,960
Look, it's time to put aside our differences.

508
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:32,410
Been ...?

509
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:33,570
Â¡No!

510
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:36,940
Where it is Human Resources when you need them?

511
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:06,980
Take it.

512
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:08,770
I do not want your filthy money.

513
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:11,210
I told you not to get in my way.

514
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:13,170
I can not!  You are in my house.

515
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:14,460
I do not want to be here...

516
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,340
Like you do not want to be here.

517
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:18,340
So why do you torture me?

518
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:20,880
The truth is that I am not an ordinary baby.

519
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:21,930
Do not tell me.

520
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:24,310
I have a mission from heaven.

521
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:26,670
Are you the child Jesus?

522
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:29,370
Yes. I am the baby Jesus.

523
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:31,510
Â¡No!

524
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,910
I'm a middle manager of the company.

525
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,100
The company?  What company?

526
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:37,350
Look.

527
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:40,180
Take it.  This explains everything.

528
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:41,940
What do you want me to do with that?

529
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:45,420
- I want you to suck.  - Suck it you!

530
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,720
It's not for you.

531
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:47,770
I Do not suck!

532
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:49,290
- Suck it.  - I do not know where you've been!

533
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:52,290
The important thing is not where you've been, but where will take.

534
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:53,570
You do not want to know?

535
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,560
Where do babies really come from?

536
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:59,570
Hickey.  Pacifier.  Bibi.

537
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:01,870
Bubu. Bobo. Baba.

538
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:04,310
ChupetÃ­n.  Sniffer.  Muffler.

539
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:06,450
It has many names.

540
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:09,650
But their power will let you know the truth.

541
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:17,820
Faster!

542
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:24,620
Mom!

543
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:25,980
Where we are?

544
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:27,090
Welcome to BebÃ©Corp!

545
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:34,540
I can not believe it.

546
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:37,940
- Thank you.  - What?

547
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:42,070
Quiet.  They can not see us or hear us.

548
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:44,230
- Are we something like virtual?  - Yes.

549
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,060
- You mean you will not feel?  - Do not.

550
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:47,280
- Not this?  Nothing.

551
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:48,550
Â¡Karate!

552
00:30:49,810 --> 00:30:52,160
Do not make a fool of myself, Templeton.  I can see you.

553
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:54,260
So here babies come from?

554
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:56,530
What did you think?  TrÃ­a that the stork.

555
00:30:56,810 --> 00:30:57,810
The fairies?

556
00:30:57,890 --> 00:30:59,840
No, my parents told me that ...

557
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:02,280
What?

558
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:04,350
No. Yuck.

559
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:06,760
Yeah, I figured it was not.

560
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,060
I can not believe my parents did not tell this.

561
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:13,480
If they knew where babies come from, they would not have one.

562
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:15,370
Like the hot dogs, by the way.

563
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:16,820
Â¡Upa!

564
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:19,930
And how come I do not remember this place?

565
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:21,070
Yes, you remembered.

566
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,470
When normal babies take away the pacifier ...

567
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:25,550
BebÃ©Corp forget.

568
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:27,110
And how is it that you're not normal?

569
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,360
Some of us, the best ...

570
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:31,150
we selected for ...

571
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:35,600
For the greatest honor.

572
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:38,080
Being senior management.

573
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:41,820
Here, Templeton, all the action.

574
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:44,270
Naptime in Sector G.

575
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:46,900
Does this place is for babies operated?

576
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:48,150
Yes.

577
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:50,410
My dad says: "Those who can, do things".

578
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:51,940
"Those who do not supervise".

579
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,430
Your dad is a hippie.

580
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:56,540
What happens when they grow up?

581
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:57,600
We do not grow.

582
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:01,030
We drink a top-secret formula that makes us be babies forever.

583
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:05,320
To work!  The hour of the formula is over!

584
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:06,910
We are in crisis!

585
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:08,540
Do not they know that we are in crisis?

586
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:09,850
Who is she?

587
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:12,420
He's my boss.  The great Chief Baby.

588
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:14,370
And why is she screaming?

589
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:16,140
You see this graph?

590
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:18,460
It looks like a giant cake.

591
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:21,090
It represents all the love in the world.

592
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:22,600
- I love cake.  - Who does not?

593
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,630
- Of Apple.  - Yes.

594
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:24,950
- No, Cherry!  - Perfect!

595
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:25,770
- pumpkin, no.  - All right.

596
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,750
It is a plant.

597
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:30,480
The point is that slice of the puppies grows more and more.

598
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:33,130
Be're stealing our love!

599
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:35,230
As you stole me.

600
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:36,570
Exactly.

601
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,460
And if this continues ...

602
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:41,310
may not leave enough pie for babies.

603
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:42,610
Nothing pie?

604
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:44,220
Nothing cake.

605
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:56,760
So my mission is to find out what is this new puppy.

606
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:59,000
Are you on a spy mission?  Great!

607
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:01,910
Yes!  Great!  And if ... When you succeed ...

608
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:04,320
I will be a legend in BebÃ©Corp.

609
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:07,190
As the Super Big Chief Baby, Baby Head Mega ...

610
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:09,150
Huge Head Baby ...

611
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:10,980
and the.

612
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,660
That's a very fat baby.

613
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:16,240
No, she's the Big Chief Baby Gorda ...

614
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:20,080
He is the Big Boss Baby Fat Super Colossal.

615
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:23,630
He was the youngest CEO Infante in the history of the company.

616
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:25,520
It was?  What happened to him?

617
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,350
He retired, years ago.

618
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:29,440
But I still try to do justice to his legend.

619
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,320
In each situation, I wonder ...

620
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:33,430
"Â¿Q-H-E-G-J-B-G-S-C?"

621
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:36,720
"What would the Big Boss Super Colossal Baby Fat?"

622
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,410
Is all you get?  Your picture on the wall?

623
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,830
Come here!

624
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:43,700
Will I get a promotion.

625
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,700
The corner office ...

626
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:47,810
with bacinica privada.

627
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,300
Genial.

628
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,710
So when you finish you coming back here?

629
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,660
D -E. I -N -M -E -D -I -A -T -O T - I-M.

630
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:56,280
I'm not a family man.  My place is behind a desk.

631
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,400
- Amazing!  - Is that right?

632
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:01,010
What?

633
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:04,690
I swear I will fasten his diaper on the wall!

634
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:07,020
Do we have news Little Chief Baby?

635
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,760
The one who sent the Templeton?

636
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,500
- I do not know.  - You are fired!

637
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,540
Oh no.

638
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:12,710
They are all fired!

639
00:34:12,930 --> 00:34:14,580
Pet Convention is in two days.

640
00:34:14,910 --> 00:34:16,350
If you do not get answers ...

641
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:18,150
You're fired, retired!

642
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,000
- Bye!  - the visit is over.

643
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,280
Why he shouted the Big Chief Baby Bossy?

644
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,780
Demands results.

645
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:29,780
Pet The convention is in two days and I have nothing!

646
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:32,780
It's her!  Do not answer!

647
00:34:40,410 --> 00:34:41,410
Siesta stress!

648
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,930
If I do not find out what it is that new puppy, and soon ...

649
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,680
not only I will not get a promotion ...

650
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:50,100
They could fire me!

651
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:53,030
Hey, easy.

652
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:55,270
Surely there are other great baby jobs, right?

653
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:57,530
Meanwhile, two days go so fast.

654
00:34:57,770 --> 00:34:58,770
Better start packing.

655
00:34:58,910 --> 00:34:59,910
What?

656
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:02,380
You do not understand, Templeton.

657
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:04,980
If I get fired, I will remove the formula.

658
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:07,110
I will become a normal baby ...

659
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,110
and I live here with you forever.

660
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:10,500
- Do not!  - Yes!

661
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:12,330
And I promise ...

662
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:14,920
every morning when you wake up ...

663
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:16,880
I'll be there.

664
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:19,880
Every night at dinner ...

665
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:21,960
I'll be there.

666
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:23,820
On every birthday party ...

667
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:25,860
I'll be there.

668
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,450
Each Christmas!

669
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,070
I'll be there

670
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:31,700
Year after year after year.

671
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:33,690
We grow old together.

672
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:39,050
You and I...

673
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:45,800
we will be brothers.

674
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:47,420
Always.

675
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:49,530
- No. No, this is terrible! - I know.

676
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,440
- Can not be.  - But if it is!

677
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:52,860
- You can not stay!  - Do not!

678
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,640
- Do not panic!  - It is right!

679
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:56,480
I know, but we need to fix this.

680
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:59,160
We must ensure that you do not get fired.

681
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:00,340
Both?

682
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:01,840
Both.

683
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:03,170
I'll help you...

684
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,610
just to get rid of you.

685
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:07,090
Done deal?

686
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:09,920
Done deal.

687
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:11,430
Not to see you again.

688
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:13,190
Ditto.

689
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,970
Now to work.

690
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,700
Come on, come on, come on.

691
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:21,290
With effect!

692
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:22,510
No no.

693
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:25,730
There is nothing about a new puppy.

694
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:27,170
You are not going to work?

695
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:28,790
I'm very busy delegating.

696
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:30,710
Knock short!

697
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:34,260
When we find the file ...

698
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:35,500
What will we do?

699
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:37,120
To send ninjas baby?

700
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:38,340
Something better.

701
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:40,190
I will write the perfect memo.

702
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,590
- Â¡Pum! - Â¡Pum!

703
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:44,010
Wait.  What is a memo?

704
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:47,370
A memo is something you write to inform people.

705
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:50,010
Is that your plan?  Is writing a report read?

706
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:51,950
How boring.

707
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:53,360
No, Templeton.

708
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:55,980
What are memos for important things.

709
00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:58,580
A memo can bring people.

710
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,250
A memo can be a call to arms ...

711
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:03,920
a manifesto, a poem.

712
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:06,850
A memo can change the world.

713
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:10,700
Whoops!  When you explain so ...

714
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:12,450
still it sounds boring.

715
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:14,450
You'll learn, kid.

716
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,720
You will learn.

717
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,870
Just a moment.  That's!

718
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,500
What?  What thing?

719
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:22,050
Watch this.  "Day take your child to work".

720
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:26,700
Why?

721
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:28,100
Because it's great!

722
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,320
It's disgusting.

723
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,590
Do not you see?  We can enter PerriCorp!

724
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,480
And find out what the new puppy!

725
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:37,650
It's no use.

726
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:39,110
You are punishment.

727
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,260
Your parents do not take us anywhere.

728
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,850
You're right.  They believe that hate us.

729
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,630
"Hate" is a strong word.

730
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,260
Correct, but strong.

731
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:52,320
We must convince them that we are truly brothers.

732
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:53,640
Clear.

733
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:55,180
We ...

734
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:56,590
Â¿Detestamos?

735
00:37:56,750 --> 00:37:57,750
No.

736
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:58,900
We please!

737
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:00,150
No. Let us ...

738
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:02,760
What what what...

739
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
What what what...

740
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:05,440
Who, who, who ...

741
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:08,540
No.

742
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:10,950
Forget this.  You do not mean ...

743
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:13,080
We want.

744
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:17,490
Vomiting a cut and I drew it.

745
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:19,860
- Here comes the little train!  - Do not.

746
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:21,150
Nothing train!

747
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:24,050
Stop the train!  Do not!  It seems digested food!

748
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:25,790
Who's there?  I have a racket!

749
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:27,010
What's going on here?

750
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:28,880
I feed the baby.

751
00:38:30,970 --> 00:38:32,030
We observe.

752
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,190
Good.

753
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,360
Good.

754
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,800
There's your train.

755
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:46,080
I have not seen sailor.  Not even it's Friday!

756
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:47,710
Come on, you're going to put this thing!

757
00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:50,040
Are you going to force?  You can not, bratty.

758
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:55,280
- What have you done to me?  - Enough!

759
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:56,880
- Come back here!  - Do not!

760
00:38:57,490 --> 00:38:58,490
Do not even dream about it.

761
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:00,590
You!

762
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,120
Tim, what are you doing here?

763
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:04,390
Oh no.

764
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,520
What is this scandal?

765
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,750
Is not it adorable?

766
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:12,900
Also I have one for you!  All aboard!

767
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,040
What?

768
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:14,890
What a pity.

769
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,080
Cheese!

770
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:19,720
Smile for the camera.

771
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:21,570
You make me feel weak.

772
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:23,860
- You have tickles?  - With me it does not work.

773
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:25,160
- Here?  - I do not feel anything.

774
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,960
Anda everyone has a weakness.

775
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:31,340
"I do not think I fit, 'said Gretel."

776
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,150
Come, look at this.

777
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:36,270
"I could go myself."

778
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:38,080
"And then, Hansel and Gretel ...

779
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:40,670
"They pushed the old baked.

780
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:44,440
"And the wicked witch burned to death."

781
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:51,170
Lets see if I understand.

782
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:54,500
It is a story about cannibalism and burn people alive.

783
00:39:54,650 --> 00:39:55,650
Yes.

784
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:57,560
No wonder kids are so confused!

785
00:39:57,930 --> 00:39:59,940
Get along is exhausting.

786
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:01,180
Same here, Tim.

787
00:40:01,350 --> 00:40:03,280
You should see your face in that picture.

788
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,480
You were ...

789
00:40:06,290 --> 00:40:07,820
No it tickles me.

790
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:10,580
Once a corporate retreat.  Strange things happen there.

791
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:13,950
What?  Do not you ever had tickled?  Not even your parents?

792
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:18,020
I am sorry.  I forgot it.

793
00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:20,970
You did not have parents, right?

794
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,600
Tim, I look like a baby ...

795
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:26,030
but I was born an adult.

796
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:29,950
I can not imagine not being a child.

797
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:32,380
Did you miss all your childhood?

798
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:36,970
Never you had someone who loved you?

799
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:42,240
You can not miss what you never had.

800
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:09,660
Wake up, shorty!

801
00:41:09,930 --> 00:41:11,570
Hey, Tim.  Wake up, champ.

802
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:13,530
- What?  - The sun has risen.

803
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:15,030
Something happens?  I am fired?

804
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,020
No, you're late to work.

805
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:18,090
What?

806
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,320
It is the day to bring children to work.  And you're my son.

807
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,170
You are officially descastigado.

808
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:23,640
- Seriously?  - Seriously.

809
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:25,590
The baby can come too?

810
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:26,850
I dont see why not.

811
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:29,320
Yes!  Yes Yes Yes!

812
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,010
Yes!

813
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,610
I would go so excited.

814
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:34,190
Look, my shovel.

815
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,190
How good.

816
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:13,390
All right, gentlemen.  Welcome to PerriCorp!

817
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:27,500
Great!  It is incredible!

818
00:42:27,730 --> 00:42:28,730
Â¡Y Tim, mira!

819
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:31,040
There's a pool of dogs!

820
00:42:31,370 --> 00:42:32,430
What toilet.

821
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:34,990
Champion, do you want a picture with Pete PerriCorp?

822
00:42:40,010 --> 00:42:42,210
No thanks.  It might scare the baby.

823
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:43,510
Well thought.

824
00:42:45,970 --> 00:42:47,970
Dad and I have to work.

825
00:42:48,250 --> 00:42:50,530
Would you like to join us and spend time with us?

826
00:42:50,770 --> 00:42:52,550
Let your brother in the PerriZona ...

827
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,440
to hang out with you.

828
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:56,030
With me?

829
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:59,410
We know that we could be with you as much as before.

830
00:42:59,690 --> 00:43:01,000
So what do you think?

831
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,160
No thanks.

832
00:43:11,310 --> 00:43:12,840
I prefer to spend some time with the baby.

833
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:15,500
- Cute.  - How cute.

834
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:20,770
You clear your goal, Templeton.

835
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:23,520
We discover what the new puppy and go home.

836
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,130
Stay in the PerriZona, yes?

837
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:27,860
Yes bye.

838
00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:49,720
There must be the record of the new puppy!

839
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:51,380
We not achieve through that door.

840
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:52,830
Through that door, no.

841
00:43:54,490 --> 00:43:55,530
The dog door.

842
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:58,710
And how we dodged the guard?

843
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:05,210
No no no.  Forget this.

844
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:06,460
Â¡No!

845
00:44:08,570 --> 00:44:10,930
Sticky gunk pants.

846
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:15,590
What a nice Perri ...!

847
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:18,700
How good!

848
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:19,740
Children.

849
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:21,850
Â¡Gatea!

850
00:44:25,810 --> 00:44:27,390
On all fours!

851
00:44:29,370 --> 00:44:32,170
I never had humiliated me so much!

852
00:44:46,590 --> 00:44:47,590
Hear!

853
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:52,480
Catch it!

854
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:55,840
What am I doing?

855
00:44:57,390 --> 00:44:58,390
Oh no!

856
00:45:11,370 --> 00:45:12,370
Yes!

857
00:45:15,370 --> 00:45:16,370
What a good dog.

858
00:45:16,930 --> 00:45:18,290
No. Do not bite.

859
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:23,560
Timothy Templeton, ninja de oficina.

860
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:26,630
- Here.  - What did you find?

861
00:45:27,690 --> 00:45:28,880
You should be here.

862
00:45:29,210 --> 00:45:30,780
NO CLOSER NOT ALLOW CHILDREN

863
00:45:31,030 --> 00:45:32,430
We begs her to enter.

864
00:45:36,510 --> 00:45:37,510
Go.

865
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:39,390
Yes it is a lot of paperwork.

866
00:45:40,050 --> 00:45:41,690
I thought the puppies were shattered everything.

867
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:47,900
This is giving me afraid.

868
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:49,530
I come for your soul.

869
00:45:49,890 --> 00:45:50,890
Do not do that!

870
00:45:50,970 --> 00:45:51,970
Wait!

871
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:54,380
There is!

872
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:55,600
The file!

873
00:45:55,780 --> 00:45:57,360
You see?  I told you!

874
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:01,100
No. I've seen this somewhere.

875
00:46:01,370 --> 00:46:03,360
We must seek to be replaced.

876
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:05,370
True.  Another record.

877
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:06,910
Yes!  Weighing the same.

878
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:09,430
So we put in the same position.

879
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:11,590
- That despite the same.  - You said it.

880
00:46:11,970 --> 00:46:14,410
I know I already said.  Hey, you hit me twice!

881
00:46:14,770 --> 00:46:16,420
Make it three.  Wait!

882
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:18,010
I think I saw one.

883
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:22,740
Manila folder, pressed edges.

884
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:25,140
As 1.5 kilos.  No, 1.4.

885
00:46:25,390 --> 00:46:26,390
Try this.

886
00:46:27,090 --> 00:46:28,090
Wait!

887
00:46:32,050 --> 00:46:33,050
It's already perfect.

888
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:46,120
Yes!

889
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:05,280
I think we should run.

890
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:08,110
I know, but it's fascinating.

891
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:11,030
I want to see how it ends.

892
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:12,360
I also.

893
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:21,250
Well, it did not end well.

894
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:24,280
FELL!

895
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:25,400
What?

896
00:47:30,530 --> 00:47:31,530
What...?

897
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:36,860
Thanks for dropping here, kids.

898
00:47:37,130 --> 00:47:38,410
Â¿Francis Francis?

899
00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:40,830
I see you've met my older brother, Eugene.

900
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:42,650
A man of few words.

901
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:44,660
No, indeed.

902
00:47:44,890 --> 00:47:47,170
Do you wear the mask again, please?

903
00:47:48,750 --> 00:47:49,950
What is all this?

904
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:52,410
Surprise!

905
00:47:52,690 --> 00:47:55,330
A pacifier BebÃ©Corp? Where did you get it?

906
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:57,770
Do not you recognize me?

907
00:47:58,070 --> 00:48:00,860
Maybe when I was young.

908
00:48:03,670 --> 00:48:06,700
Â¿Super Colossal Big Boss Baby?

909
00:48:08,290 --> 00:48:10,890
He is he? And it's you?

910
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:13,970
Although older and wrinkled.

911
00:48:16,650 --> 00:48:17,720
That is not right.

912
00:48:18,030 --> 00:48:19,850
No. You were my hero!

913
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:21,860
How did you end up here?

914
00:48:22,710 --> 00:48:25,670
You know what I do to children who ask many questions about me?

915
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,190
Â¡Eugenio!

916
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:34,760
I read my record!

917
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:38,310
And I baked cookies!

918
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:41,150
Eugenio, my chair.

919
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:45,790
Well, it all started in BebÃ©Corp ...

920
00:48:46,150 --> 00:48:48,410
a long long time ago.

921
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,890
I was a senior executive ...

922
00:48:51,170 --> 00:48:52,820
I was going straight to the top.

923
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:55,240
Everybody loved me!

924
00:48:55,530 --> 00:48:57,690
They gave me a promotion, luxury office!

925
00:48:57,990 --> 00:48:59,270
Even my own ...!

926
00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:00,590
Â¿Bacinica personal?

927
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:03,530
I had it all.

928
00:49:03,710 --> 00:49:04,710
But one day...

929
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:07,000
I discovered something terrible.

930
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:09,330
It was growing.

931
00:49:09,650 --> 00:49:11,170
The formula did not work anymore.

932
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:14,660
It turned out to be lactose intolerant.

933
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:15,960
- Do not! - Yes!

934
00:49:16,230 --> 00:49:18,990
I had to appear before the board.

935
00:49:19,350 --> 00:49:20,680
What is "vindictive" board?

936
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:23,170
Older babies heads in the world.

937
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:25,110
I thought you loved me.

938
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:27,960
But I was replaced with someone new.

939
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:30,170
Someone younger.

940
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:31,610
That's horrible.

941
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:34,520
Suddenly, she had all the love ...

942
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:36,290
all the attention.

943
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:39,210
You know what it feels like, huh, Tim?

944
00:49:39,570 --> 00:49:41,310
It hurts, does not it?

945
00:49:42,430 --> 00:49:44,550
Yes. Yes it hurts.

946
00:49:47,330 --> 00:49:48,740
And then what happened?

947
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:50,560
Well...

948
00:49:50,910 --> 00:49:52,200
I got fired!

949
00:49:52,890 --> 00:49:55,560
And I took my special formula.

950
00:49:55,750 --> 00:49:58,390
Then I was sent here to live with!

951
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:00,820
- Family! - Oh, no, Francis!

952
00:50:01,090 --> 00:50:02,560
BebÃ©Corp betrayed me!

953
00:50:02,850 --> 00:50:06,240
And I can finally take revenge!

954
00:50:07,310 --> 00:50:09,440
With the Eternal Puppy!

955
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:10,740
That's it?

956
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:12,040
No no.

957
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:14,120
Imagine a puppy that never grows.

958
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:18,160
A puppy puppy that remains forever.

959
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:21,730
When you launch my Cubs Eternos in every corner of the world ...

960
00:50:21,930 --> 00:50:23,280
They are so adorable ...

961
00:50:23,550 --> 00:50:24,820
Cute!

962
00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:29,760
No one will want a baby ever, ever again.

963
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:32,660
The end of BebÃ©Corp!

964
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:37,950
Please.

965
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:40,800
A puppy that never grows? It is impossible!

966
00:50:41,590 --> 00:50:42,590
Or not?

967
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:47,390
It was, until you brought me the essential ingredient.

968
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:52,210
My secret formula.

969
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:54,100
It's mine! It's mine!

970
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:56,060
It's all mine.

971
00:50:56,270 --> 00:50:57,160
Â¡No!

972
00:50:57,270 --> 00:51:00,740
They brought me just what I needed to destroy BebÃ©Corp!

973
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:02,400
- Do not! - Yes!

974
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:04,460
They fell straight into my trap!

975
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:06,690
- Do not get away with it! - Yes, we're going to ...

976
00:51:06,850 --> 00:51:08,170
What? To accuse?

977
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:10,600
Who will tell, Tim? To your parents?

978
00:51:10,770 --> 00:51:11,770
And children?

979
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:13,620
They should stay in PerriZona.

980
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:15,750
The two go with me to Las Vegas.

981
00:51:16,050 --> 00:51:18,020
So do not meddle.

982
00:51:18,290 --> 00:51:21,730
I would not want that removed.

983
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:23,710
They never leave us alone.

984
00:51:23,950 --> 00:51:24,950
Really?

985
00:51:26,970 --> 00:51:29,340
Wait for the expert know ...

986
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:32,640
PerriCorp in child care.

987
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:37,800
Oh no.

988
00:51:40,910 --> 00:51:42,930
- Do not be nervous. - It's just one day.

989
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,410
Back very soon.

990
00:51:44,770 --> 00:51:46,740
In addition, they will be in good hands.

991
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:51,530
So is!

992
00:51:51,810 --> 00:51:55,220
Eugenia is almost perfect in every way.

993
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:56,320
No.

994
00:51:56,450 --> 00:51:59,100
Please do not go with him. Francis Francis tries ...

995
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:00,580
Believe me ...

996
00:52:00,730 --> 00:52:03,260
Eugenia will not take your eyes off your children.

997
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,540
Not for a second.

998
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:07,330
That reassures me.

999
00:52:07,990 --> 00:52:09,800
Now they see.

1000
00:52:10,530 --> 00:52:12,540
And now, no.

1001
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:15,940
Â¡Adiosito!

1002
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:19,390
To the airport!

1003
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:34,220
It's over. I'm fried.

1004
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:35,520
What do we do, Templeton?

1005
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:36,820
What do we do?

1006
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:39,070
To go to the airport to arrest Francis Francis!

1007
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:40,800
Before the plane takes off!

1008
00:52:40,990 --> 00:52:43,690
Yes! But how do we avoid the evil nanny?

1009
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:45,660
Well, we could do something.

1010
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:54,940
Hey, it is not that serious.

1011
00:52:57,770 --> 00:52:58,770
You're good?

1012
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:03,040
What happens?

1013
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:07,420
Do not look at me!

1014
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:09,560
Oh no!

1015
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:11,580
Without the formula, I become a normal baby!

1016
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:14,300
You know, Gugu gaga. All the matter!

1017
00:53:14,550 --> 00:53:15,550
Oh no!

1018
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:17,840
Gross!

1019
00:53:20,310 --> 00:53:22,670
I'm a time bomb baby!

1020
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:27,230
I'll become a helpless baby vomits and makes poops!

1021
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:30,350
Wait. That gives me an idea.

1022
00:53:30,650 --> 00:53:31,650
What? What thing?

1023
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:33,860
I have had many nannies ...

1024
00:53:34,130 --> 00:53:36,220
and all are afraid of one thing.

1025
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:50,260
Well, the secret to frying butter ...

1026
00:53:50,540 --> 00:53:53,110
It is a touch of margarita.

1027
00:53:54,530 --> 00:53:56,150
Hey, Miss Macho!

1028
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:58,630
The baby! I think he's sick!

1029
00:54:01,430 --> 00:54:03,050
You have to do something!

1030
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:07,230
How awful!

1031
00:54:14,310 --> 00:54:16,220
- Â¡Templeton! - Â¡Delicioso!

1032
00:54:19,630 --> 00:54:21,050
Gross! WE entered the mouth!

1033
00:54:21,910 --> 00:54:23,670
Me too!

1034
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:26,370
I think I'm going to vomit!

1035
00:54:32,250 --> 00:54:33,250
Â¡Bucitum!

1036
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:40,030
An hour Lacks the plane takes off!

1037
00:54:40,670 --> 00:54:41,680
Use the bike.

1038
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:42,990
The bike?

1039
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:44,990
I dont know...

1040
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:47,440
Let's move on!

1041
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:48,540
- Wait! - What?

1042
00:54:48,790 --> 00:54:50,070
Where are you going? Templeton!

1043
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:51,520
Always wear a helmet.

1044
00:54:54,020 --> 00:54:55,680
Adiosito, head loo!

1045
00:54:58,710 --> 00:54:59,850
We're not going to achieve!

1046
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:17,780
Â¡Staci!

1047
00:55:17,990 --> 00:55:19,120
Â¡Staci, responde!

1048
00:55:19,910 --> 00:55:21,280
Â¡Ay, enough!

1049
00:55:21,550 --> 00:55:23,170
- Are you you, boss? - Code Red!

1050
00:55:23,410 --> 00:55:25,860
I WILL pursues a murderous nanny! Gather the team!

1051
00:55:26,150 --> 00:55:27,150
Done, boss.

1052
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:28,220
- Hello. - Hello.

1053
00:55:28,370 --> 00:55:29,410
- Hello! - Code Red!

1054
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:30,660
Aware!

1055
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:35,040
code red. I repeat ...

1056
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:36,320
Code Red!

1057
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:40,780
What do you do? Get moving!

1058
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:41,980
It's against the law!

1059
00:55:42,290 --> 00:55:43,290
Take, I pay the fine!

1060
00:55:43,410 --> 00:55:44,410
Come on!

1061
00:55:52,370 --> 00:55:53,370
I think we lost!

1062
00:55:55,170 --> 00:55:56,670
No, we did not lost.

1063
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:05,000
Flower Power!

1064
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:21,600
Very well done!

1065
00:56:23,410 --> 00:56:24,510
It broke!

1066
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:35,810
Run Run Run.

1067
00:56:45,630 --> 00:56:47,030
Run Run Run.

1068
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:09,210
Tim, faster!

1069
00:57:09,530 --> 00:57:10,750
I can not!

1070
00:57:10,970 --> 00:57:12,110
If you can!

1071
00:57:12,410 --> 00:57:14,460
You can, Templeton. The view to the front.

1072
00:57:14,650 --> 00:57:15,710
I said eyes front!

1073
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,070
Turn up the ass! Pedaling raring!

1074
00:57:18,410 --> 00:57:21,260
If you do not win the day, the day you win you.

1075
00:57:23,030 --> 00:57:24,030
Good!

1076
00:57:25,940 --> 00:57:28,150
My wheels! I can not stand without training wheels!

1077
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:31,450
What you think you can or you can not, it's true.

1078
00:57:31,710 --> 00:57:32,810
What are you talking about?

1079
00:57:33,050 --> 00:57:35,500
The road to success is not a straight line, Templeton ...

1080
00:57:35,810 --> 00:57:37,210
but a bumpy ride ...

1081
00:57:37,490 --> 00:57:38,510
like a ship at sea.

1082
00:57:38,530 --> 00:57:39,790
And you're the captain!

1083
00:57:40,060 --> 00:57:41,640
Let taming a turbulent sea!

1084
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:46,300
I'm the captain who tames the sea!

1085
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:51,360
Good!

1086
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:52,930
Tree! I'm going to crash!

1087
00:57:53,250 --> 00:57:55,040
If you aim to fail, always triumph.

1088
00:57:55,330 --> 00:57:56,700
- What? - Do not point to failure!

1089
00:57:59,340 --> 00:58:00,860
! I'm getting there! Whatever I'm doing it!

1090
00:58:01,090 --> 00:58:02,880
When success is a habit ...

1091
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:04,390
everything is downhill.

1092
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:06,360
Look!

1093
00:58:06,450 --> 00:58:07,690
They are there! Mom Dad!

1094
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:11,300
Train!

1095
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:14,140
Â¡Detente!

1096
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:16,330
What do you do?

1097
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:20,720
- We will make it. - I do not have a phrase for this!

1098
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:29,730
You did!

1099
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,790
Do not! We did it.

1100
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:34,360
And your wheels coaches.

1101
00:58:41,430 --> 00:58:42,430
Make way!

1102
00:58:42,590 --> 00:58:43,660
Baby on Board!

1103
00:58:43,950 --> 00:58:44,960
Hold your diaper!

1104
00:58:46,550 --> 00:58:47,840
Get down and cover!

1105
00:58:49,630 --> 00:58:50,630
Whoa, dude!

1106
00:58:50,850 --> 00:58:52,310
Depth review in both.

1107
00:58:57,180 --> 00:58:58,970
They are there! Mom Dad!

1108
00:58:59,220 --> 00:59:00,220
Not so fast!

1109
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:02,520
Oh no.

1110
00:59:04,510 --> 00:59:05,510
Â¡Templeton!

1111
00:59:05,830 --> 00:59:07,120
- Hears! - Sorry!

1112
00:59:10,510 --> 00:59:11,510
Where are you?

1113
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:13,610
Oh no!

1114
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:15,050
No again!

1115
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:16,200
Not now!

1116
00:59:17,810 --> 00:59:18,810
What...?

1117
00:59:22,410 --> 00:59:23,410
No no no!

1118
00:59:23,570 --> 00:59:24,570
Quick!

1119
00:59:24,870 --> 00:59:26,580
I think I ate $ 1.75.

1120
00:59:26,860 --> 00:59:29,870
Excuse me, with permission. Mom! Dad!

1121
00:59:30,940 --> 00:59:31,940
Quick! Move!

1122
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:33,160
We will lose the plane!

1123
00:59:33,260 --> 00:59:34,800
- Do not! - I warned!

1124
00:59:35,730 --> 00:59:36,730
Wait!

1125
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:39,290
- Do not! - Do not.

1126
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:41,330
Mom! Dad! Stop!

1127
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:44,400
Â¡No!

1128
00:59:45,270 --> 00:59:47,010
No no no.

1129
00:59:51,430 --> 00:59:52,890
They left.

1130
00:59:54,670 --> 00:59:55,690
I failed.

1131
00:59:57,190 --> 00:59:59,970
It would have reached my parents if I had not come back for you!

1132
01:00:00,270 --> 01:00:02,490
What? We had arrived with plenty of time!

1133
01:00:02,740 --> 01:00:04,530
If thou wilt walk in bike like a normal kid!

1134
01:00:04,850 --> 01:00:06,840
We can not stop the launch.

1135
01:00:07,130 --> 01:00:09,100
Does matters? My parents are in danger!

1136
01:00:09,420 --> 01:00:11,940
I care! BebÃ©Corp will go bankrupt!

1137
01:00:12,810 --> 01:00:13,970
It's the only thing you're talking about!

1138
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:16,520
I do not even know what being part of a family!

1139
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:18,590
And you do not know what it is to have a job!

1140
01:00:18,830 --> 01:00:23,130
You do not know anything about hugs, stories, or special songs!

1141
01:00:23,470 --> 01:00:25,780
Please! Stop acting like a baby.

1142
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:27,100
You are a baby!

1143
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:28,800
Recant.

1144
01:00:29,050 --> 01:00:31,020
My life was perfect until you came!

1145
01:00:31,230 --> 01:00:34,310
Believe me, the feeling is mutual. I wish I'd met you not!

1146
01:00:34,620 --> 01:00:35,910
Would not you were born!

1147
01:00:47,140 --> 01:00:48,360
Where are you going?

1148
01:00:51,030 --> 01:00:52,060
Good!

1149
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:03,710
Blackbird singing in the dead of night

1150
01:01:04,850 --> 01:01:08,730
Take these broken wings and learn to fly

1151
01:01:09,980 --> 01:01:11,920
All your life

1152
01:01:13,870 --> 01:01:18,880
Only expect this moment to take flight

1153
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:25,470
Timothy Templeton, please take the courtesy phone.

1154
01:01:25,730 --> 01:01:30,250
Timothy Leslie Templeton, please take the courtesy phone.

1155
01:01:30,580 --> 01:01:31,910
Leslie.

1156
01:01:33,730 --> 01:01:34,530
Hello?

1157
01:01:34,730 --> 01:01:36,890
It's me. Do not hang. Tim!

1158
01:01:38,770 --> 01:01:42,410
Tim, I was born. I was hired.

1159
01:01:42,610 --> 01:01:43,740
What do you mean?

1160
01:01:43,970 --> 01:01:46,470
BebÃ©Corp is the only home I've ever known.

1161
01:01:48,190 --> 01:01:50,550
You're right, I do not know what is ...

1162
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:51,990
being part of a family.

1163
01:01:54,410 --> 01:01:55,720
But I do care.

1164
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Really?

1165
01:01:57,210 --> 01:01:58,400
Yes.

1166
01:01:58,590 --> 01:02:02,500
And the only way to save is to stop both Francis Francis.

1167
01:02:02,670 --> 01:02:03,540
Yes.

1168
01:02:03,690 --> 01:02:05,400
I can not do it without you, Tim.

1169
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:07,950
I need you.

1170
01:02:08,170 --> 01:02:10,750
- If we make a good team. - Do not.

1171
01:02:11,330 --> 01:02:14,170
I literally did not reach the knobs.

1172
01:02:14,530 --> 01:02:15,530
True.

1173
01:02:16,430 --> 01:02:17,760
Neglected, Tim.

1174
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:19,520
Let's save your parents.

1175
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:22,070
And your company.

1176
01:02:22,740 --> 01:02:24,520
But how do we go to Las Vegas?

1177
01:02:24,770 --> 01:02:26,780
We need a miracle.

1178
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:38,320
Follow that Elvis!

1179
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:39,590
Why?

1180
01:02:40,140 --> 01:02:41,750
Where there is Elvis, there Vegas!

1181
01:02:41,980 --> 01:02:42,980
There's another one!

1182
01:02:44,190 --> 01:02:45,190
And other!

1183
01:02:45,780 --> 01:02:46,970
They are everywhere!

1184
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:50,330
Tim, there's our flight!

1185
01:02:50,780 --> 01:02:52,050
And there goes our ticket!

1186
01:02:59,210 --> 01:03:00,330
Â¡Hey! Â¡Don't be cruel!

1187
01:03:00,620 --> 01:03:01,740
I am sorry!

1188
01:03:02,510 --> 01:03:03,700
- Oh thanks! - Oh, baby!

1189
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:05,060
Many thanks.

1190
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:06,360
Hi.

1191
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:08,590
Hi.

1192
01:03:08,730 --> 01:03:10,510
Input please.

1193
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:11,960
Just a moment.

1194
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:15,290
It was stolen!

1195
01:03:15,590 --> 01:03:17,470
Â¿Imitates a un imitator of Elvis?

1196
01:03:17,670 --> 01:03:18,670
Get him!

1197
01:03:20,910 --> 01:03:21,910
Â¡Alto!

1198
01:03:22,820 --> 01:03:23,830
The ghost of Elvis!

1199
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:27,500
We need seats!

1200
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:28,720
Quick, over here!

1201
01:03:38,010 --> 01:03:39,240
What is this place?

1202
01:03:39,430 --> 01:03:42,610
This, Templeton, is first class.

1203
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:43,880
Why it is empty?

1204
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:45,290
No one can afford it.

1205
01:03:45,650 --> 01:03:48,660
That's why it's so wonderful.

1206
01:03:49,410 --> 01:03:51,260
Hello! Ross captain speaking.

1207
01:03:51,510 --> 01:03:53,490
Ladies and gentlemen, and economy class.

1208
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:56,450
Fasten seat belts. Let's take off.

1209
01:03:57,720 --> 01:03:59,100
What's the matter, Templeton?

1210
01:03:59,950 --> 01:04:03,970
My parents always hold hands when we took off.

1211
01:04:11,610 --> 01:04:14,240
Actions are a shambles today.

1212
01:04:22,940 --> 01:04:24,700
Ladies and gentlemen, Captain Ross again.

1213
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:26,740
You see, I turned off the seat belt sign.

1214
01:04:26,970 --> 01:04:28,790
What are you two doing here?

1215
01:04:30,510 --> 01:04:32,050
We are the children of Captain Ross.

1216
01:04:32,310 --> 01:04:33,650
He sat us here.

1217
01:04:34,390 --> 01:04:36,980
So they want to bring them something?

1218
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:38,200
Whatever?

1219
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:39,610
Whatever.

1220
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:43,400
Good. Francis Francis.

1221
01:04:43,780 --> 01:04:46,360
You'll never kidnap the parents of Tim Turto.

1222
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:49,700
Please, I wish it were that easy.

1223
01:04:49,950 --> 01:04:51,040
What is your plan?

1224
01:04:51,350 --> 01:04:52,750
You will not write a memo, do you?

1225
01:04:54,190 --> 01:04:55,190
No.

1226
01:04:55,550 --> 01:04:57,710
Hey, you say you did not have children, right?

1227
01:04:57,880 --> 01:04:58,880
And if you try?

1228
01:04:59,190 --> 01:05:00,470
- No I can not. - It's fun!

1229
01:05:00,700 --> 01:05:02,170
Takes, you get into character.

1230
01:05:02,590 --> 01:05:03,880
I dont know. I feel silly!

1231
01:05:04,190 --> 01:05:05,780
You! Dile algo cruel.

1232
01:05:06,100 --> 01:05:07,350
Okay, okay.

1233
01:05:09,460 --> 01:05:12,720
So you study at a community college, right?

1234
01:05:13,010 --> 01:05:13,730
I dont know.

1235
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:14,960
Keep going!

1236
01:05:15,020 --> 01:05:18,590
And you dare to ask me a bonus now?

1237
01:05:19,270 --> 01:05:20,270
Â¿Ves?

1238
01:05:20,340 --> 01:05:21,650
You're getting into the role.

1239
01:05:23,870 --> 01:05:25,660
I can not believe it.

1240
01:05:26,030 --> 01:05:27,940
Your exit interview is over!

1241
01:05:29,710 --> 01:05:30,720
That was good.

1242
01:05:31,210 --> 01:05:32,210
And who was he?

1243
01:05:32,370 --> 01:05:33,830
- Captain! - What?

1244
01:05:35,950 --> 01:05:36,950
Â¡En garde!

1245
01:05:44,550 --> 01:05:45,550
Hard!

1246
01:05:50,230 --> 01:05:51,230
There it goes!

1247
01:05:57,870 --> 01:05:59,090
Watch your rear!

1248
01:06:00,010 --> 01:06:02,360
- Taking! - Dodge, blocks and attacks!

1249
01:06:02,750 --> 01:06:04,190
It sounds like a law firm!

1250
01:06:04,290 --> 01:06:06,200
Nice try! Attention!

1251
01:06:06,750 --> 01:06:08,170
You are fired!

1252
01:06:08,460 --> 01:06:10,770
And here is your final settlement. Ha!

1253
01:06:11,180 --> 01:06:13,560
Wait! You must not end with "Ha!"

1254
01:06:13,820 --> 01:06:14,820
Â¿No?

1255
01:06:15,380 --> 01:06:17,220
You must finish with "Argh!"

1256
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:18,740
It is understood! Argh!

1257
01:06:21,150 --> 01:06:22,150
Excellent!

1258
01:06:22,220 --> 01:06:23,920
Thank you. I just got carried away.

1259
01:06:24,330 --> 01:06:26,190
Ladies and gentlemen, and tourist class ...

1260
01:06:26,510 --> 01:06:27,820
to the left of the plane ...

1261
01:06:28,030 --> 01:06:31,440
you will see that we approach the fabulous Las Vegas.

1262
01:06:36,430 --> 01:06:37,430
Land in sight!

1263
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:38,910
That's right, comrade.

1264
01:06:47,910 --> 01:06:49,000
Goodbye dad! Thank you!

1265
01:06:49,290 --> 01:06:50,620
- You're welcome. What? - Let's move on.

1266
01:06:50,930 --> 01:06:53,050
- Go to Heartbreak Hotel? - I'm going to Heartbreak Hotel.

1267
01:06:53,130 --> 01:06:54,140
- I also! - I also!

1268
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:55,160
I also!

1269
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:01,120
We have to get to the convention center!

1270
01:07:01,340 --> 01:07:02,610
Do we take a taxi?

1271
01:07:02,790 --> 01:07:05,960
Ray! And I spent all my travel expenses. That's better.

1272
01:07:09,420 --> 01:07:10,420
Perfect.

1273
01:07:11,630 --> 01:07:13,310
Excuse me, ladies.

1274
01:07:14,020 --> 01:07:15,340
Could you take us home?

1275
01:07:15,510 --> 01:07:18,900
Jimmy is sick and needs an expensive medicine.

1276
01:07:21,340 --> 01:07:22,680
Where do they live, honey?

1277
01:07:23,020 --> 01:07:25,400
In the convention center.

1278
01:07:30,430 --> 01:07:31,860
Bye sweetheart!

1279
01:07:32,140 --> 01:07:33,410
Have fun at your party!

1280
01:07:33,710 --> 01:07:35,020
Girls love babies.

1281
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,760
People do not know Long Island iced tea.

1282
01:07:40,410 --> 01:07:43,340
How to find my parents here?

1283
01:07:43,610 --> 01:07:44,560
Â¡Tim!

1284
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:45,600
Over there.

1285
01:07:45,980 --> 01:07:47,130
Well, where is PerriCorp?

1286
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:49,400
PerriCorp, PerriCorp, PerriCorp...

1287
01:07:49,730 --> 01:07:51,390
AHA! Here it is. I found it!

1288
01:07:54,770 --> 01:07:55,970
But how...?

1289
01:07:56,650 --> 01:07:58,490
Hey, where did you get?

1290
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:04,480
Not again!

1291
01:08:05,950 --> 01:08:07,680
Please! I need you!

1292
01:08:08,630 --> 01:08:09,630
I came back! I came back!

1293
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:12,290
What's going on?

1294
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:13,500
So is.

1295
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:17,450
Let's launch a new puppy on every continent!

1296
01:08:17,770 --> 01:08:19,360
In each country!

1297
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:24,150
We're going to take over the world one heart at a time!

1298
01:08:27,150 --> 01:08:29,190
- Tim, are there! - Mom Dad!

1299
01:08:29,430 --> 01:08:31,410
Imagine a puppy that never grows ...

1300
01:08:31,660 --> 01:08:33,550
and never gets old.

1301
01:08:34,290 --> 01:08:38,380
A puppy that is small forever.

1302
01:08:39,140 --> 01:08:42,710
I present all you are going to love in life:

1303
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,450
The Eternal Puppy!

1304
01:08:50,450 --> 01:08:51,450
Mom?

1305
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:55,470
Â¡No mires, Templeton!

1306
01:08:58,320 --> 01:08:59,680
Hears! What are you doing here?

1307
01:09:00,820 --> 01:09:01,820
Mom Dad!

1308
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:03,220
What are you doing here?

1309
01:09:03,470 --> 01:09:05,110
What do Tim and baby here?

1310
01:09:05,310 --> 01:09:07,530
What do all of us here, really?

1311
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:09,520
What's happening here?

1312
01:09:10,110 --> 01:09:11,110
You got my parents!

1313
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:12,870
We are here for them.

1314
01:09:12,940 --> 01:09:13,940
Go for them!

1315
01:09:14,110 --> 01:09:16,270
They go their Eternal Puppy!

1316
01:09:17,630 --> 01:09:18,780
We must go behind the scenes.

1317
01:09:21,830 --> 01:09:22,940
Over there!

1318
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:25,600
Run!

1319
01:09:29,620 --> 01:09:30,960
Quick, quick, quick!

1320
01:09:33,370 --> 01:09:35,670
Left Right! Left Right!

1321
01:09:39,890 --> 01:09:40,890
Yes!

1322
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:47,090
Gas. Butts. Caca.

1323
01:09:48,090 --> 01:09:50,230
Look at all that formula!

1324
01:09:56,390 --> 01:09:58,160
What a way to launch a product.

1325
01:09:58,250 --> 01:09:59,250
Oh no!

1326
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:01,690
He put them under rocket!

1327
01:10:13,790 --> 01:10:16,070
Elvis has left the building!

1328
01:10:20,260 --> 01:10:21,740
Mom Dad!

1329
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:23,000
I'm going!

1330
01:10:23,140 --> 01:10:26,080
Well said! Come on, Tim! Run Run!

1331
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:30,350
Launch started.

1332
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:34,570
I'll throw my Cubs Eternos and there is nothing they can do!

1333
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,000
Â¡No!

1334
01:10:37,150 --> 01:10:39,630
BebÃ©Corp stole all my love ...

1335
01:10:39,870 --> 01:10:41,900
and now I'm going to get.

1336
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:43,690
You should understand me.

1337
01:10:44,260 --> 01:10:47,070
You'd replaced, like me!

1338
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:48,700
Do not! I'm not like you!

1339
01:10:49,030 --> 01:10:50,030
Brat!

1340
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:52,620
Let go of our parents! Her parents! Parents!

1341
01:10:52,980 --> 01:10:53,980
Yes!

1342
01:10:54,040 --> 01:10:56,220
You could have had the love of your parents just for you!

1343
01:10:56,550 --> 01:10:57,550
But no!

1344
01:10:57,630 --> 01:10:58,630
You ruined it!

1345
01:10:58,850 --> 01:11:00,900
Let that baby you give orders.

1346
01:11:01,150 --> 01:11:02,150
He does not work for me.

1347
01:11:02,350 --> 01:11:03,660
We are partners!

1348
01:11:05,050 --> 01:11:06,410
I do not tickle.

1349
01:11:07,130 --> 01:11:08,160
Hears! And the baby?

1350
01:11:08,510 --> 01:11:09,860
Everyone is ticklish!

1351
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:10,900
My ears!

1352
01:11:11,020 --> 01:11:12,160
Â¡Basta!

1353
01:11:13,940 --> 01:11:15,140
Brats!

1354
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:25,000
Nothing can stop my revenge.

1355
01:11:25,370 --> 01:11:27,030
Neither you nor anyone!

1356
01:11:27,270 --> 01:11:28,640
BebÃ©Corp over!

1357
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:30,280
I won! Ha!

1358
01:11:30,570 --> 01:11:31,570
You're wrong!

1359
01:11:32,460 --> 01:11:34,200
You should never end with "Ja"!

1360
01:11:35,590 --> 01:11:37,250
- True! - What?

1361
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:39,110
You should end up with ...

1362
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:40,500
Â¡Argh!

1363
01:11:41,390 --> 01:11:42,500
Â¡En garde!

1364
01:11:44,920 --> 01:11:45,800
You are fired!

1365
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:47,840
And here's your severance!

1366
01:11:54,050 --> 01:11:55,670
Take that, you bastard!

1367
01:11:55,890 --> 01:11:56,710
Â¡Argh!

1368
01:11:56,790 --> 01:11:58,530
One minute and counting.

1369
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:03,200
- Help! - Help us!

1370
01:12:04,380 --> 01:12:07,120
Tim! What are you doing?

1371
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:09,980
Â¡No!

1372
01:12:10,270 --> 01:12:11,760
Mom, Dad, I'm coming!

1373
01:12:12,020 --> 01:12:13,020
It's you?

1374
01:12:13,370 --> 01:12:15,270
Relax folks, dads! I got this!

1375
01:12:15,490 --> 01:12:16,890
- You're good? - Is the baby okay?

1376
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:18,100
Yes, the baby is fine.

1377
01:12:18,270 --> 01:12:19,320
Who said that?

1378
01:12:19,570 --> 01:12:20,990
It was me!

1379
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:22,250
The baby is fine.

1380
01:12:23,970 --> 01:12:25,100
It does not open!

1381
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:26,400
What's going on?

1382
01:12:26,770 --> 01:12:27,770
Just a moment!

1383
01:12:28,010 --> 01:12:29,170
Oye.

1384
01:12:29,370 --> 01:12:30,470
I know how to move my parents.

1385
01:12:30,820 --> 01:12:32,180
- How? - Using the puppies!

1386
01:12:32,550 --> 01:12:33,550
Upa.

1387
01:12:33,980 --> 01:12:35,060
Upa need.

1388
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:36,880
What if you become a baby again?

1389
01:12:36,970 --> 01:12:38,910
I'll be fine. Well well.

1390
01:12:39,180 --> 01:12:40,180
Good!

1391
01:12:40,230 --> 01:12:41,470
I'll be fine.

1392
01:12:41,750 --> 01:12:43,050
Hold your diaper!

1393
01:12:53,940 --> 01:12:54,940
We move!

1394
01:12:55,140 --> 01:12:56,290
Why do we move?

1395
01:12:56,620 --> 01:12:57,940
Mom and Dad, Hold on!

1396
01:12:59,330 --> 01:13:01,090
Thirty seconds.

1397
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:02,690
Oh no! Wait!

1398
01:13:03,370 --> 01:13:04,370
Resist!

1399
01:13:04,550 --> 01:13:05,910
Quick, Tim! Take your parents ...

1400
01:13:06,330 --> 01:13:07,450
from here.

1401
01:13:08,550 --> 01:13:09,710
You need to jump!

1402
01:13:10,360 --> 01:13:11,950
You can, it's a cinch!

1403
01:13:12,970 --> 01:13:15,130
Do not! I have no bread! Jump!

1404
01:13:16,530 --> 01:13:19,520
Do not Cry. I am sorry. Please do not cry!

1405
01:13:21,460 --> 01:13:22,460
Twenty seconds.

1406
01:13:27,710 --> 01:13:29,270
Fifteen seconds.

1407
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:38,630
Blackbird singing in the dead of night

1408
01:13:40,280 --> 01:13:43,960
Take these broken wings and learn to fly

1409
01:13:46,140 --> 01:13:48,000
All your life

1410
01:13:49,450 --> 01:13:54,070
Only expect this moment to take flight

1411
01:13:55,770 --> 01:13:56,770
- Three ... - I have you!

1412
01:13:59,130 --> 01:14:00,130
Two one.

1413
01:14:13,170 --> 01:14:14,170
Yes!

1414
01:14:15,940 --> 01:14:17,850
Hey, are you still there?

1415
01:14:19,640 --> 01:14:20,640
Â¡Dog!

1416
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:26,040
What happened? We won?

1417
01:14:26,270 --> 01:14:27,070
- We won! - We won?

1418
01:14:27,250 --> 01:14:29,860
- We won! We won! - We won! Yes!

1419
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:32,520
Siesta victory!

1420
01:14:37,250 --> 01:14:38,250
Whatever ruined everything!

1421
01:14:40,980 --> 01:14:42,740
It's not fair! It's not fair!

1422
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:44,040
That is not right.

1423
01:14:44,780 --> 01:14:46,530
Now If you are going to pay!

1424
01:14:46,730 --> 01:14:49,580
Oh yeah? Well Mess with someone your own size!

1425
01:14:51,650 --> 01:14:52,650
What?

1426
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:56,050
Â¡Eugenio! Â¡BÃ¡jame!

1427
01:14:56,430 --> 01:14:58,140
You heard me? I'm your boss!

1428
01:15:06,010 --> 01:15:08,470
This time educate well.

1429
01:15:12,470 --> 01:15:14,840
Sure it will be fine.

1430
01:15:15,340 --> 01:15:16,450
Tim, what happens?

1431
01:15:16,730 --> 01:15:18,150
Mom, Dad, wait!

1432
01:15:19,730 --> 01:15:20,760
Yes!

1433
01:15:21,310 --> 01:15:22,530
- Â¿Tim? - Â¡Tim!

1434
01:15:22,780 --> 01:15:24,210
Tim! You're good?

1435
01:15:24,430 --> 01:15:25,430
We are ok.

1436
01:15:25,680 --> 01:15:26,680
Saved us.

1437
01:15:26,870 --> 01:15:28,050
You are our hero.

1438
01:15:28,280 --> 01:15:29,640
And a great big brother.

1439
01:15:30,870 --> 01:15:32,910
We love many both.

1440
01:15:33,050 --> 01:15:34,130
What the two?

1441
01:15:34,330 --> 01:15:35,920
With all my heart.

1442
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:41,820
Let's go home.

1443
01:15:49,610 --> 01:15:50,960
How I look?

1444
01:15:54,290 --> 01:15:55,640
Excellent.

1445
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:05,990
Team, good work.

1446
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:09,590
Staci, this letter will let you enter the school you choose.

1447
01:16:12,270 --> 01:16:13,920
- Kinder garden? - So is.

1448
01:16:14,190 --> 01:16:15,520
And if there's something else ...

1449
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:16,760
Increase?

1450
01:16:16,860 --> 01:16:17,990
Staci, you have no salary.

1451
01:16:18,260 --> 01:16:19,500
- Many billion! - Eight!

1452
01:16:19,670 --> 01:16:20,480
- Tricycle! - Roller skates!

1453
01:16:20,670 --> 01:16:21,440
- Sweet? - Palettes!

1454
01:16:21,650 --> 01:16:22,650
Done deal.

1455
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:26,100
You're the best boss in the world.

1456
01:16:26,380 --> 01:16:28,830
should not always follow the guidelines of the company, huh?

1457
01:16:29,180 --> 01:16:30,420
It's okay to think for themselves.

1458
01:16:30,550 --> 01:16:31,270
- No sir! - Never!

1459
01:16:31,540 --> 01:16:32,650
Bad idea!

1460
01:16:32,830 --> 01:16:34,110
That's the attitude!

1461
01:16:34,380 --> 01:16:35,540
- True! - Certainly, sir!

1462
01:16:35,610 --> 01:16:36,690
- You are big! - The best!

1463
01:16:38,240 --> 01:16:39,380
Shot, fortachÃ³n.

1464
01:16:40,650 --> 01:16:41,710
You earned it.

1465
01:16:45,870 --> 01:16:47,630
You want to hug me, right?

1466
01:16:50,760 --> 01:16:52,730
I'll miss you too. Yes.

1467
01:16:56,010 --> 01:16:58,170
- Yeah, yeah. - Everything will be fine, burly.

1468
01:16:58,670 --> 01:16:59,680
Good...

1469
01:17:01,100 --> 01:17:02,100
you did.

1470
01:17:02,250 --> 01:17:04,340
No. We did.

1471
01:17:05,060 --> 01:17:08,050
By the way, congratulations on your promotion.

1472
01:17:08,450 --> 01:17:12,120
Luxury office, private potty. All that.

1473
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:13,730
Hey, you too.

1474
01:17:14,120 --> 01:17:16,130
Your parents have to yourself.

1475
01:17:20,220 --> 01:17:22,900
What will I tell my parents when you leave?

1476
01:17:23,180 --> 01:17:24,180
Neglected.

1477
01:17:24,380 --> 01:17:26,810
BebÃ©Corp has a protocol for these situations.

1478
01:17:27,010 --> 01:17:29,640
It will be as if he had not been born.

1479
01:17:31,110 --> 01:17:32,300
I almost forget it!

1480
01:17:34,890 --> 01:17:36,630
I can not believe it! Borreguita!

1481
01:17:36,930 --> 01:17:38,150
- The you fixed it! - Yes.

1482
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:40,720
It was like new. It is very strong.

1483
01:17:42,410 --> 01:17:44,800
Well, we have what we wanted.

1484
01:17:45,010 --> 01:17:46,410
Everyone wins.

1485
01:17:58,510 --> 01:17:59,520
I think I ...

1486
01:17:59,790 --> 01:18:00,790
Yes.

1487
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:03,820
Well, keep studying.

1488
01:18:04,060 --> 01:18:06,050
Actually, I have no choice.

1489
01:18:06,260 --> 01:18:07,260
Yes it's correct.

1490
01:18:08,710 --> 01:18:10,350
- Bye, Tim. - Bye.

1491
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:26,520
Yeah right.

1492
01:18:55,280 --> 01:18:57,240
He went as suddenly as it came.

1493
01:18:57,800 --> 01:18:58,530
Bye.

1494
01:18:58,760 --> 01:19:01,790
At last, my life was perfect again.

1495
01:19:07,370 --> 01:19:09,190
Forget the baby.

1496
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:11,710
Forget baby

1497
01:19:26,580 --> 01:19:27,580
Â¡Upsi!

1498
01:19:27,710 --> 01:19:28,890
Sorry, big guy.

1499
01:19:48,820 --> 01:19:51,160
Surprise!

1500
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:53,260
OUR HEROE!

1501
01:19:56,710 --> 01:19:58,300
Hurray!

1502
01:20:00,580 --> 01:20:02,060
You've been promoted!

1503
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:30,720
Do you want to forget the baby?

1504
01:20:32,230 --> 01:20:33,580
No thanks. That's OK.

1505
01:20:34,200 --> 01:20:35,330
Very good.

1506
01:22:11,020 --> 01:22:12,120
Argh.

1507
01:22:26,290 --> 01:22:27,670
Baby Dear Boss:

1508
01:22:27,900 --> 01:22:29,730
I do not usually write a lot ...

1509
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:32,920
but now I know that the memos are very important.

1510
01:22:33,130 --> 01:22:35,340
Although I did not study economics ...

1511
01:22:35,550 --> 01:22:37,690
I learned to share in kindergarten.

1512
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:40,460
And if there is enough love for both ...

1513
01:22:40,740 --> 01:22:42,960
then I give you all mine.

1514
01:23:12,870 --> 01:23:14,510
I would like to offer you a job.

1515
01:23:14,660 --> 01:23:15,660
It is very heavy ...

1516
01:23:15,910 --> 01:23:17,940
and there will be no salary.

1517
01:23:18,830 --> 01:23:21,810
But the good thing is that you never get fired.

1518
01:23:23,430 --> 01:23:24,970
And I promise something.

1519
01:23:25,550 --> 01:23:28,060
Every morning when you wake up, I'll be there.

1520
01:23:28,350 --> 01:23:30,620
Every night at dinner, I'll be there.

1521
01:23:30,920 --> 01:23:33,330
On every birthday, every Christmas ...

1522
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:34,660
I'll be there.

1523
01:23:37,250 --> 01:23:39,770
Year after year after year.

1524
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:47,630
We grow together.

1525
01:23:48,970 --> 01:23:52,190
And you and I will always be ...

1526
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:53,400
brothers.

1527
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:54,760
Always.

1528
01:23:56,640 --> 01:23:57,640
FAMILY

1529
01:24:15,640 --> 01:24:18,610
Wake up, dwarf. They are 7 am

1530
01:24:21,300 --> 01:24:22,880
What's the point, Maguin?

1531
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:25,320
Because they are 7 am

1532
01:24:25,640 --> 01:24:28,200
I have one mission and you do the hard stool.

1533
01:24:32,900 --> 01:24:34,420
Nothing happens, dwarf.

1534
01:24:34,700 --> 01:24:36,490
Sometimes, I also confused me.

1535
01:24:36,680 --> 01:24:39,060
Especially during the summer time.

1536
01:24:39,420 --> 01:24:41,100
Overtaking, delay.

1537
01:24:41,390 --> 01:24:43,490
There is no calendars in the realm of magicians!

1538
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:47,250
There is no spring, there is only darkness and winter!

1539
01:24:47,480 --> 01:24:49,790
I'm not confused, Maguin.

1540
01:24:49,970 --> 01:24:50,970
It is strange.

1541
01:25:04,890 --> 01:25:06,460
Tim, look who came!

1542
01:25:07,380 --> 01:25:08,860
It's your new ...

1543
01:25:09,110 --> 01:25:10,180
Little brother!

1544
01:25:10,980 --> 01:25:12,340
You arrived! Yes you get!

1545
01:25:12,650 --> 01:25:13,650
Careful, careful.

1546
01:25:13,960 --> 01:25:15,870
Volviste!

1547
01:25:16,760 --> 01:25:19,780
Saluda a Theodore Lindsey Templeton.

1548
01:25:20,330 --> 01:25:21,330
Â¿Lindsey?

1549
01:25:24,200 --> 01:25:26,030
Cosquillitas! Cosquillitas!

1550
01:25:26,270 --> 01:25:27,400
Take this.

1551
01:25:31,510 --> 01:25:33,530
So that's my story.

1552
01:25:35,430 --> 01:25:36,520
Our history.

1553
01:25:37,570 --> 01:25:41,210
Luckily for me and my brother, I had a happy ending.

1554
01:25:43,170 --> 01:25:45,100
Is it a true story, Daddy?

1555
01:25:45,370 --> 01:25:47,470
Well, honey, that's how I remember it.

1556
01:25:47,780 --> 01:25:49,450
- But you know what I discovered? - What?

1557
01:25:49,710 --> 01:25:51,830
There is a lot for everyone.

1558
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:53,080
Also for me?

1559
01:25:53,160 --> 01:25:54,510
Especially for you.

1560
01:25:54,870 --> 01:25:56,100
Ask your Uncle Ted.

1561
01:25:56,370 --> 01:25:58,590
Hello, I knew that you'll have a little sister.

1562
01:25:58,910 --> 01:26:00,110
I wanted a horse.

1563
01:26:00,310 --> 01:26:02,830
Takes, small. Buy a horse.

1564
01:26:03,050 --> 01:26:05,650
I'm proud of you, Leslie.

1565
01:26:06,030 --> 01:26:07,640
Ditto, Lindsey.

1566
01:26:17,980 --> 01:26:19,870
Hello, little sister.

1567
01:26:24,040 --> 01:26:29,030
Subtitled by Antillan0 The Boss Baby 2017

1568
01:26:29,050 --> 01:26:39,050


1569
01:29:13,340 --> 01:29:14,120
Â¡Argh!

1570
01:29:14,280 --> 01:29:15,370
All right, kids.

1571
01:29:15,620 --> 01:29:16,620
Bedtime.

1572
01:29:16,810 --> 01:29:18,850
Please, Mom. Just a little more.

1573
01:29:19,070 --> 01:29:20,280
It's okay.

1574
01:35:55,190 --> 01:35:58,520
Awaken, dwarves. It's time to go.

1575
01:35:58,730 --> 01:36:02,030
Go live your life of farmers.

1576
01:36:03,170 --> 01:36:04,390
Â¡Ya vÃ¡yanse!
