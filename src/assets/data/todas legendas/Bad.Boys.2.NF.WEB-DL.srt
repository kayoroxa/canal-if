00:26:19,125 --> 00:26:23,041
coming around the corner?

770
00:26:23,083 --> 00:26:24,542
Stand by.

771
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:26,959
I don't want to get spotted,

772
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:26,959
take a burn.

773
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,583
Zoepound a bunch of pirates,

774
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,583
man. Steal anything.

775
00:26:44,583 --> 00:26:46,875
Black Suburban at 10 o'clock.

776
00:26:46,917 --> 00:26:49,792
Oh, come on, baby.

777
00:26:46,917 --> 00:26:49,792
Park it at the top.

778
00:26:49,834 --> 00:26:51,917
Roberto, she's coming to you.

779
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,959
I got her.

780
00:26:59,291 --> 00:27:02,333
This is Falcon One, guys.

781
00:26:59,291 --> 00:27:02,333
I got her coming up.

782
00:27:02,375 --> 00:27:04,542
Heads up, guys.

783
00:27:02,375 --> 00:27:04,542
I got an orange muscle car.

784
00:27:04,583 --> 00:27:05,750
Looks to be three

785
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:07,750
<i>black male occupants.</i>

786
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:08,959
It's out of our field of vision.

787
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:08,959
Bring it up.

788
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,709
All right, be aware,

789
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:12,542
we got three bogeys

790
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:12,542
unidentified.

791
00:27:22,959 --> 00:27:24,458
Guys, we got three bogeys.

792
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,417
They're splitting up.

793
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,417
They're moving.

794
00:27:26,458 --> 00:27:27,667
<i>Be aware. They're approaching...</i>

795
00:27:27,709 --> 00:27:28,792
Shit. Shit.

796
00:27:31,834 --> 00:27:32,792
Jesus!

797
00:27:32,834 --> 00:27:33,792
Fuck, it's a hit!

798
00:27:33,834 --> 00:27:34,917
Shit.

799
00:27:44,166 --> 00:27:45,667
Agent down. Agent down.

800
00:27:47,834 --> 00:27:49,417
Roberto,

801
00:27:47,834 --> 00:27:49,417
fucking follow them!

802
00:27:49,458 --> 00:27:50,458
I'm on it! I'm on it!

803
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,792
Shit!

804
00:27:51,834 --> 00:27:53,166
Stay here!

805
00:27:53,208 --> 00:27:55,667
Son of a bitch!

806
00:28:35,792 --> 00:28:36,959
It's Syd!

807
00:28:37,959 --> 00:28:40,917
Move! Move!

808
00:28:43,208 --> 00:28:46,667
Man, what is your sister into?

809
00:28:56,834 --> 00:28:57,917
Sidewalk! Sidewalk!

810
00:29:00,041 --> 00:29:01,208
Move! Move! Move!

811
00:29:02,834 --> 00:29:03,917
Shit.

812
00:29:14,041 --> 00:29:15,041
Shit!

813
00:29:15,083 --> 00:29:17,208
I need backup on Canal,

814
00:29:15,083 --> 00:29:17,208
now!

815
00:29:22,875 --> 00:29:24,542
You just get ready to shoot.

816
00:29:28,875 --> 00:29:29,917
Police!

817
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,041
Stop the car!

818
00:29:33,083 --> 00:29:34,000
Man, your badge?

819
00:29:34,041 --> 00:29:35,917
He has a gun! Shoot him!

820
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:52,917
Mike, she's in

821
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:52,917
trouble, man.

822
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,041
Move! Get out of the way!

823
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:14,291
I think I done just got mad.

824
00:30:23,792 --> 00:30:25,083
Gun! Gun! Gun!

825
00:30:23,792 --> 00:30:25,083
Hold on.

826
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:37,291
Now show them your badge!

827
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:09,625
This shit is crazy.

828
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:10,792
I know, right?

829
00:31:10,834 --> 00:31:11,917
Move! Move!

830
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,917
Get the world down here!

831
00:31:52,834 --> 00:31:53,917
Mag!

832
00:32:10,709 --> 00:32:11,917
Go! Go!

833
00:32:20,333 --> 00:32:22,583
Get out!

834
00:32:22,625 --> 00:32:23,875
You, drive!

835
00:32:31,417 --> 00:32:32,500
Go!

836
00:32:41,166 --> 00:32:43,083
Go, go, go, Mike!

837
00:32:41,166 --> 00:32:43,083
Punch that shit! Punch it!

838
00:33:17,083 --> 00:33:18,166
Shit!

839
00:33:23,834 --> 00:33:24,917
Move! Move!

840
00:33:29,959 --> 00:33:31,000
Don't lose her, Mike!

841
00:33:31,041 --> 00:33:33,125
This is what I do!

842
00:33:49,125 --> 00:33:51,208
Aw, shit! Shit.

843
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:53,417
And definitely shoot

844
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:53,417
that motherfucker that just...

845
00:33:53,458 --> 00:33:54,750
Oh, man, my headlight.

846
00:33:56,291 --> 00:33:58,125
Shoot back! Shoot back!

847
00:33:56,291 --> 00:33:58,125
Shoot! Shoot!

848
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:12,917
Oh, man, what the...?!

849
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:12,917
What are you doing, man?

850
00:34:12,959 --> 00:34:14,083
That's my bad.

851
00:34:14,125 --> 00:34:15,500
Shoot outside!

852
00:34:15,542 --> 00:34:17,417
Pay attention to

853
00:34:15,542 --> 00:34:17,417
what you're doing.

854
00:34:35,291 --> 00:34:37,000
Oh, these dudes

855
00:34:35,291 --> 00:34:37,000
is off the chain!

856
00:34:47,834 --> 00:34:49,250
Jesus! Fuck!

857
00:34:55,875 --> 00:34:57,291
This is some sick shit!

858
00:34:57,333 --> 00:34:58,917
Yep, it's about to

859
00:34:57,333 --> 00:34:58,917
get sicker.

860
00:35:09,542 --> 00:35:11,083
Watch out! Watch out!

861
00:35:12,875 --> 00:35:14,166
Oh, sh...!

862
00:35:14,208 --> 00:35:15,792
Oh, they are not

863
00:35:14,208 --> 00:35:15,792
about to do that.

864
00:35:15,834 --> 00:35:17,834
Hell, yes, they are!

865
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,458
You see that?

866
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,458
They throwing cars!

867
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,583
How am I not see that?

868
00:35:37,208 --> 00:35:39,041
Mike, I'm just trying to help,

869
00:35:37,208 --> 00:35:39,041
okay?

870
00:35:39,083 --> 00:35:40,500
You know what'd be real

871
00:35:39,083 --> 00:35:40,500
fucking helpful, Marcus?

872
00:35:40,542 --> 00:35:42,000
Just shut the fuck up

873
00:35:40,542 --> 00:35:42,000
and let me drive!

874
00:35:42,041 --> 00:35:43,083
Let's try that!

875
00:35:50,417 --> 00:35:52,709
Hey, come on, man,

876
00:35:50,417 --> 00:35:52,709
with the screaming shit!

877
00:35:54,792 --> 00:35:57,000
I'm trying to concentrate

878
00:35:54,792 --> 00:35:57,000
on dodging these motherfuckers.

879
00:36:03,834 --> 00:36:04,917
Just relax.

880
00:36:11,834 --> 00:36:13,792
That motherfucker flipped!

881
00:36:13,834 --> 00:36:15,291
That one

882
00:36:13,834 --> 00:36:15,291
puckered up my butthole.

883
00:36:15,333 --> 00:36:17,417
Almost fucking crushed my head.

884
00:36:36,875 --> 00:36:37,959
The boat!

885
00:36:52,834 --> 00:36:55,000
Whoo!

886
00:37:01,083 --> 00:37:03,250
I lost them.

887
00:37:03,291 --> 00:37:04,792
Yeah, I've got your cargo

888
00:37:03,291 --> 00:37:04,792
to the backup drop point.

889
00:37:04,834 --> 00:37:08,375

00:37:22,709 --> 00:37:24,917
What the fuck

894
00:37:22,709 --> 00:37:24,917
is going on, Syd?

895
00:37:24,959 --> 00:37:26,875
Some desk

896
00:37:24,959 --> 00:37:26,875
you're driving.

897
00:37:26,917 --> 00:37:30,542
Get over here. I'm undercover.

898
00:37:26,917 --> 00:37:30,542
And please call off your dogs.

899
00:37:30,583 --> 00:37:33,166
I got DEA watching my back,

900
00:37:30,583 --> 00:37:33,166
so don't blow my case.

901
00:37:33,208 --> 00:37:34,542
We saved your life.

902
00:37:34,583 --> 00:37:36,375
Yeah, and I appreciate that,

903
00:37:36,417 --> 00:37:39,000
but what I don't appreciate is

904
00:37:36,417 --> 00:37:39,000
you two following me over here,

905
00:37:39,041 --> 00:37:40,709
nearly burning a case

906
00:37:39,041 --> 00:37:40,709
that took five months to set up.

907
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:42,959
So now we lie

908
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:42,959
to each other?

909
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,625
Is that what we do?

910
00:37:44,667 --> 00:37:45,834
What do you want me

911
00:37:44,667 --> 00:37:45,834
to do, Marcus?

912
00:37:45,875 --> 00:37:46,834
All right, y'all.

913
00:37:46,875 --> 00:37:48,166
Fuck that, Mike, she's wrong.

914
00:37:48,208 --> 00:37:49,792
Calm down. Relax.

915
00:37:49,834 --> 00:37:51,917
Syd, are there drugs

916
00:37:49,834 --> 00:37:51,917
in that truck?

917
00:37:51,959 --> 00:37:52,959
There's cash.

918
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:53,917
Where's it going?

919
00:37:53,959 --> 00:37:55,542
I can't tell you that.

920
00:37:55,583 --> 00:37:56,792
Why not?

921
00:37:56,834 --> 00:37:58,250
Because I have a career,

922
00:37:58,291 --> 00:37:59,709
and if I want to keep it,

923
00:37:58,291 --> 00:37:59,709
I have rules to follow.

924
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:01,208
What's that

925
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:01,208
supposed to mean?

926
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:02,792
It means that my orders are

927
00:38:02,834 --> 00:38:04,875
under no circumstances

928
00:38:02,834 --> 00:38:04,875
share information with Miami PD,

929
00:38:04,917 --> 00:38:06,291
because they got

930
00:38:04,917 --> 00:38:06,291
too many leaks.

931
00:38:06,333 --> 00:38:08,709
Oh. I'm Miami PD now?

932
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:10,709
You done forgot I'm

933
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:10,709
your big brother, huh?

934
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:11,875
You know what, Syd?

935
00:38:11,917 --> 00:38:13,709
That shit you did

936
00:38:11,917 --> 00:38:13,709
was reckless,

937
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:16,834
it was stupid, and it

938
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:16,834
was dangerous. Okay?

939
00:38:16,875 --> 00:38:18,750
I'm telling Mommy. Okay?

940
00:38:18,792 --> 00:38:21,208
I'm definitely

941
00:38:18,792 --> 00:38:21,208
leaking that shit.

942
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:23,083
Hey, Marcus...

943
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,792
Syd, come on,

944
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,792
he got a point.

945
00:38:26,834 --> 00:38:28,709
Your brother loves you.

946
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:30,250
And not to mention

947
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:30,250
a little thing

948
00:38:30,291 --> 00:38:31,750
called

949
00:38:30,291 --> 00:38:31,750
professional courtesy.

950
00:38:31,792 --> 00:38:33,667
You bouncing around

951
00:38:31,792 --> 00:38:33,667
in somebody's backyard,

952
00:38:33,709 --> 00:38:36,709
you should maybe let them

953
00:38:33,709 --> 00:38:36,709
know about it.

954
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,041
First time

955
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,041
using your gun?

956
00:38:44,083 --> 00:38:46,750
Hey, you handled

957
00:38:44,083 --> 00:38:46,750
yourself very well.

958
00:38:46,792 --> 00:38:49,166
Too bad your partner

959
00:38:46,792 --> 00:38:49,166
didn't notice.

960
00:38:50,583 --> 00:38:51,875
Thanks.

961
00:38:51,917 --> 00:38:53,667

So, where do we go from here?

1078
00:42:45,625 --> 00:42:48,375

that they're obviously

01:14:06,208 --> 01:14:07,500
We had a wire

2096
01:14:06,208 --> 01:14:07,500
in the house.

2097
01:14:07,542 --> 01:14:09,834
You two have a warrant

2098
01:14:07,542 --> 01:14:09,834
for that wire?

2099
01:14:09,875 --> 01:14:11,750
Look, fuck that, okay?

2100
01:14:11,792 --> 01:14:13,417
You don't know

2101
01:14:11,792 --> 01:14:13,417
the kind of danger

2102
01:14:13,458 --> 01:14:15,291
that you're in, Syd.

2103
01:14:15,333 --> 01:14:16,709
I am fully aware,

2104
01:14:16,750 --> 01:14:19,417
and I am fully capable

2105
01:14:16,750 --> 01:14:19,417
of what I am doing.

2106
01:14:19,458 --> 01:14:20,834
Marcus, I am not

2107
01:14:19,458 --> 01:14:20,834
your baby sister anymore.

2108
01:14:20,875 --> 01:14:22,083
For the DEA,

2109
01:14:22,125 --> 01:14:23,625
you ain't nothing

2110
01:14:22,125 --> 01:14:23,625
but a honeypot.

2111
01:14:23,667 --> 01:14:24,792
What'd you just say?

2112
01:14:24,834 --> 01:14:26,375
Look, that's why

2113
01:14:24,834 --> 01:14:26,375
you got the job,

2114
01:14:26,417 --> 01:14:28,792
because you look good

2115
01:14:26,417 --> 01:14:28,792
in a bathing suit.

2116
01:14:28,834 --> 01:14:30,959
All right, let's

2117
01:14:28,834 --> 01:14:30,959
sit down somewhere.

2118
01:14:33,458 --> 01:14:35,542
All right, look, Syd,

2119
01:14:35,583 --> 01:14:37,125
there's some shit

2120
01:14:35,583 --> 01:14:37,125
you need to know.

2121
01:14:37,166 --> 01:14:39,417
Johnny Tapia is cutting up

2122
01:14:37,166 --> 01:14:39,417
Russian mob bosses

2123
01:14:39,458 --> 01:14:40,500
in his mom's kitchen.

2124
01:14:40,542 --> 01:14:41,917
In the kitchen, Syd.

2125
01:14:41,959 --> 01:14:44,458
He found a severed finger

2126
01:14:41,959 --> 01:14:44,458
by the crock pot.

2127
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:48,041
You're about to be in the middle

2128
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:48,041
of a drug war.

2129
01:14:48,083 --> 01:14:50,417
No disrespect, but Miami PD

2130
01:14:48,083 --> 01:14:50,417
has arrested this guy 12 times

2131
01:14:50,458 --> 01:14:51,625
with no convictions.

2132
01:14:51,667 --> 01:14:53,041
Why don't you guys

2133
01:14:51,667 --> 01:14:53,041
just hang back

2134
01:14:53,083 --> 01:14:54,208
and let us

2135
01:14:53,083 --> 01:14:54,208
bring him down?

2136
01:14:54,250 --> 01:14:55,792
Guys, look, I need this, okay,

2137
01:14:55,834 --> 01:14:57,458
and I am this close.

2138
01:14:57,500 --> 01:14:58,709
What's "this close"?

2139
01:14:58,750 --> 01:15:00,500
I'm in charge

2140
01:14:58,750 --> 01:15:00,500
of money laundering

2141
01:15:00,542 --> 01:15:02,041
for his entire operation.

2142
01:15:02,083 --> 01:15:03,875
In a month or two we'll have

2143
01:15:02,083 --> 01:15:03,875
enough for a conviction,

2144
01:15:03,917 --> 01:15:05,458
and this whole thing

2145
01:15:03,917 --> 01:15:05,458
will be over with.

2146
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:07,125
What about a day or two?

2147
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:07,125
Sound better?

2148
01:15:07,166 --> 01:15:09,375
Marcus and I

2149
01:15:07,166 --> 01:15:09,375
think we found the key

2150
01:15:09,417 --> 01:15:11,542
to Tapia's

2151
01:15:09,417 --> 01:15:11,542
whole operation.

2152
01:15:11,583 --> 01:15:13,542
You have nothing to say

2153
01:15:11,583 --> 01:15:13,542
now, huh? Just stuck, right?

2154
01:15:13,583 --> 01:15:14,875
Okay...

2155
01:15:14,917 --> 01:15:16,792
time out, y'all. Damn!

2156
01:15:16,834 --> 01:15:18,291
We got this peckerwood

2157
01:15:16,834 --> 01:15:18,291
that's going to put us down

2158
01:15:18,333 --> 01:15:20,750
with the transport end

2159
01:15:18,333 --> 01:15:20,750
of Tapia's operation.

2160
01:15:20,792 --> 01:15:21,709
Do you want in?

2161
01:15:21,750 --> 01:15:22,709
Mike, why would you...

2162
01:15:22,750 --> 01:15:23,834
When?

2163
01:15:23,875 --> 01:15:24,875
Tonight.

2164
01:15:24,917 --> 01:15:26,917
Page me.

2165
01:15:24,917 --> 01:15:26,917
Should I bring my thong?

2166
01:15:29,667 --> 01:15:33,834
Get your bitch hands off!

2167
01:15:29,667 --> 01:15:33,834
I'll knock you the fuck out!

2168
01:15:33,875 --> 01:15:37,125
Mike, we're trying to keep

2169
01:15:33,875 --> 01:15:37,125
her out of trouble, man,

2170
01:15:37,166 --> 01:15:39,166
not invite her in.

2171
01:15:39,208 --> 01:15:40,792
Man, I just

2172
01:15:39,208 --> 01:15:40,792
figured, you know,

2173
01:15:40,834 --> 01:15:42,333
if she with us,

2174
01:15:42,375 --> 01:15:45,417
that's just less trouble

2175
01:15:42,375 --> 01:15:45,417
she could get into.

2176
01:15:45,458 --> 01:15:47,667
I'm going to keep it

2177
01:15:45,458 --> 01:15:47,667
real with you too, man.

2178
01:15:47,709 --> 01:15:49,208
I think she can

2179
01:15:47,709 --> 01:15:49,208
handle herself.

2180
01:15:49,250 --> 01:15:50,792
I'm going to keep it

2181
01:15:49,250 --> 01:15:50,792
real with you.

2182
01:15:50,834 --> 01:15:51,834
Don't nobody

2183
01:15:50,834 --> 01:15:51,834
know my sister

2184
01:15:51,875 --> 01:15:53,792
the way I do, okay?

2185
01:15:53,834 --> 01:15:56,208
She doesn't

2186
01:15:53,834 --> 01:15:56,208
make good choices, Mike.

2187
01:15:56,250 --> 01:15:57,917
She's not

2188
01:15:56,250 --> 01:15:57,917
street-smart.

2189
01:15:57,959 --> 01:15:59,041
Doesn't make good...

2190
01:15:59,083 --> 01:16:00,208
Like, what kind

2191
01:15:59,083 --> 01:16:00,208
of choices?

2192
01:16:00,250 --> 01:16:01,667
Men, for one.

2193
01:16:01,709 --> 01:16:04,542
She's attracted

2194
01:16:01,709 --> 01:16:04,542
to these dumb,

2195
01:16:04,583 --> 01:16:09,125
flashy, just musclebound

2196
01:16:04,583 --> 01:16:09,125
dickheads, Mike, you know?

2197
01:16:09,166 --> 01:16:12,125
Cock diesel motherfuckers

2198
01:16:09,166 --> 01:16:12,125
that can't even fucking turn

2199
01:16:12,166 --> 01:16:15,417
to wipe

2200
01:16:12,166 --> 01:16:15,417
their ass, Mike.

2201
01:16:15,458 --> 01:16:16,417
You feel me?

2202
01:16:16,458 --> 01:16:17,709
Yeah.

2203
01:16:17,750 --> 01:16:18,709
You know?

2204
01:16:18,750 --> 01:16:20,458
Just dumb as a bucket of shrimp.

2205
01:16:20,500 --> 01:16:25,125
Yeah. Yeah, that shit's crazy.

2206
01:16:25,166 --> 01:16:26,709
I mean, you don't think

2207
01:16:25,166 --> 01:16:26,709
maybe you...

2208
01:16:26,750 --> 01:16:28,500
maybe you

2209
01:16:26,750 --> 01:16:28,500
didn't, like,

2210
01:16:28,542 --> 01:16:29,917
get a chance to know

2211
01:16:28,542 --> 01:16:29,917
any of them?

2212
01:16:29,959 --> 01:16:31,542
I'm going to give

2213
01:16:29,959 --> 01:16:31,542
the next one a chance.

2214
01:16:31,583 --> 01:16:35,333
A chance

2215
01:16:31,583 --> 01:16:35,333
to whup his ass.

2216
01:16:35,375 --> 01:16:37,375
Whup the shit

2217
01:16:35,375 --> 01:16:37,375
out of him.

2218
01:16:37,417 --> 01:16:38,875
Oh, you going to fight him?

2219
01:16:38,917 --> 01:16:40,000
What I'm going to do

2220
01:16:40,041 --> 01:16:42,166
ain't even going

2221
01:16:40,041 --> 01:16:42,166
to be legal.

2222
01:16:42,208 --> 01:16:45,166
I might be up in here

2223
01:16:42,208 --> 01:16:45,166
with these motherfuckers.

2224
01:16:45,208 --> 01:16:48,417
Do you know what I mean?

2225
01:16:48,458 --> 01:16:49,750
The fuck you looking at?

2226
01:16:49,792 --> 01:16:52,375
Thank you kindly.

2227
01:16:52,417 --> 01:16:53,834
Who sprung me?

2228
01:16:53,875 --> 01:16:54,959
Hey, Cousin Floyd.

2229
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:55,959
Oh, you.

2230
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,041
Remember me?

2231
01:17:01,083 --> 01:17:03,667
Cheese.

2232
01:17:03,709 --> 01:17:05,041
Y'all look great together.

2233
01:17:05,083 --> 01:17:06,458
What the fuck

2234
01:17:05,083 --> 01:17:06,458
you doing?

2235
01:17:06,500 --> 01:17:07,792
Oh, no, just

2236
01:17:06,500 --> 01:17:07,792
a little insurance.

2237
01:17:07,834 --> 01:17:09,667
You going to help us find

2238
01:17:07,834 --> 01:17:09,667
<i>Dixie 7,</i>

2239
01:17:09,709 --> 01:17:11,041
and let us know what that boat

2240
01:17:09,709 --> 01:17:11,041
has to do with Johnny Tapia.

2241
01:17:11,083 --> 01:17:13,208
I ain't no snitch.

2242
01:17:13,250 --> 01:17:17,792
Oh, you ain't no snitch?

2243
01:17:13,250 --> 01:17:17,792
Oh, damn. That's a shame.

2244
01:17:17,834 --> 01:17:19,417
Know what I'm going to do?

2245
01:17:19,458 --> 01:17:22,166
I'm going to send

2246
01:17:19,458 --> 01:17:22,166
a special 8 x 10

2247
01:17:22,208 --> 01:17:24,291
to his KKK buddies back in jail.

2248
01:17:24,333 --> 01:17:26,417
You know what?

2249
01:17:24,333 --> 01:17:26,417
It's a digital photo too.

2250
01:17:26,458 --> 01:17:27,667
So we can pretty much

2251
01:17:27,709 --> 01:17:29,291
do whatever we want

2252
01:17:27,709 --> 01:17:29,291
to do with it.

2253
01:17:29,333 --> 01:17:30,875
Hey, look, by the time

2254
01:17:29,333 --> 01:17:30,875
we get done with you,

2255
01:17:30,917 --> 01:17:32,834
you going be in the next

2256
01:17:30,917 --> 01:17:32,834
Busta Rhymes video on BET.

2257
01:17:32,875 --> 01:17:34,834
Tuck ass.

2258
01:17:36,333 --> 01:17:38,166
I got my rights.

2259
01:17:39,333 --> 01:17:40,875
I'm worried.

2260
01:17:40,917 --> 01:17:42,667
There's too much heat

2261
01:17:40,917 --> 01:17:42,667
around in Miami.

2262
01:17:42,709 --> 01:17:46,208
I can feel it.

2263
01:17:42,709 --> 01:17:46,208
I can feel it.

2264
01:17:46,250 --> 01:17:50,709
We need to put my money

2265
01:17:46,250 --> 01:17:50,709
in coffins to Cuba faster.

2266
01:17:50,750 --> 01:17:53,917
You should tell the mortuary

2267
01:17:50,750 --> 01:17:53,917
to speed things up. All right?

2268
01:18:02,750 --> 01:18:04,583
That's the channel marker

2269
01:18:02,750 --> 01:18:04,583
way out there.

2270
01:18:04,625 --> 01:18:07,959
They make the drop

2271
01:18:04,625 --> 01:18:07,959
mostly at dawn,

2272
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,333
but there'll be one today,

2273
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,333
though.

2274
01:18:13,875 --> 01:18:19,417
Syd, you talk to Mama?

2275
01:18:13,875 --> 01:18:19,417
She's got hives.

2276
01:18:19,458 --> 01:18:22,250
Oh, and I told Mama

2277
01:18:19,458 --> 01:18:22,250
about your Cubano boyfriend.

2278
01:18:22,291 --> 01:18:24,166
He ain't invited

2279
01:18:22,291 --> 01:18:24,166
to Christmas dinner.

2280
01:18:24,208 --> 01:18:25,208
Change the station.

2281
01:18:25,250 --> 01:18:27,458
More music, less Marcus.

2282
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:29,542
If you open the door,

2283
01:18:29,583 --> 01:18:32,458
he'll be a black Dr. Phil

2284
01:18:29,583 --> 01:18:32,458
for the next 40 minutes.

2285
01:18:32,500 --> 01:18:37,041
Syd, you might not want

2286
01:18:32,500 --> 01:18:37,041
to get too flirty with Mike.

2287
01:18:37,083 --> 01:18:39,041
Your boyfriend might cut off

2288
01:18:37,083 --> 01:18:39,041
his trigger finger.

2289
01:18:41,583 --> 01:18:43,542
Maybe Mike's been

2290
01:18:41,583 --> 01:18:43,542
flirting with me.

2291
01:18:43,583 --> 01:18:44,834
Did you ever think

2292
01:18:43,583 --> 01:18:44,834
about that?

2293
01:18:44,875 --> 01:18:47,208
Ooh...Mm-mm.

2294
01:18:47,250 --> 01:18:48,792
Trigger Mike?

2295
01:18:48,834 --> 01:18:51,083
Not like this.

2296
01:18:48,834 --> 01:18:51,083
Don't play with the boy.

2297
01:18:51,125 --> 01:18:52,625
Seriously.

2298
01:18:51,125 --> 01:18:52,625
Don't play with the boy.

2299
01:18:52,667 --> 01:18:54,500
Just tell him about New York.

2300
01:18:54,542 --> 01:18:56,291
Do it.

2301
01:18:54,542 --> 01:18:56,291
Tell me what?

2302
01:18:56,333 --> 01:18:58,583
Oh, shit. Is he

2303
01:18:56,333 --> 01:18:58,583
walking down the steps?

2304
01:18:58,625 --> 01:19:01,792
Oh, shit.

2305
01:18:58,625 --> 01:19:01,792
He coming down.

2306
01:19:01,834 --> 01:19:02,959
It's okay.

2307
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,208
Yeah, you done

2308
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,208
fucked up.

2309
01:19:05,250 --> 01:19:06,500
You done fucked up.

2310
01:19:06,542 --> 01:19:09,834
Um, you remember...

2311
01:19:09,875 --> 01:19:11,834
Remember I went to New York?

2312
01:19:09,875 --> 01:19:11,834
You remember?

2313
01:19:11,875 --> 01:19:16,834
And...I said, "Syd."

2314
01:19:16,875 --> 01:19:18,041
I ran in...

2315
01:19:18,083 --> 01:19:20,250
Syd ran into me

2316
01:19:18,083 --> 01:19:20,250
in New York

2317
01:19:20,291 --> 01:19:21,875
on the street in that place.

2318
01:19:21,917 --> 01:19:24,792
And I said, "What's up?"

2319
01:19:24,834 --> 01:19:28,125
And we was hungry,

2320
01:19:24,834 --> 01:19:28,125
so then...

2321
01:19:28,166 --> 01:19:31,959
she had fish.

2322
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,959
It was grouper,

2323
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:36,667
and then I had

2324
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:36,667
some chicken.

2325
01:19:36,709 --> 01:19:38,500
Remember I was supposed

2326
01:19:36,709 --> 01:19:38,500
to come home,

2327
01:19:38,542 --> 01:19:42,000
but I didn't?

2328
01:19:42,041 --> 01:19:44,709
We went out on a date.

2329
01:19:44,750 --> 01:19:46,542
Five, actually.

2330
01:19:46,583 --> 01:19:47,834
Now we're seeing

2331
01:19:46,583 --> 01:19:47,834
each other.

2332
01:19:49,250 --> 01:19:50,667
Hold up.

2333
01:19:50,709 --> 01:19:53,542
You know, really out of

2334
01:19:50,709 --> 01:19:53,542
respect for you, Marcus,

2335
01:19:53,583 --> 01:19:54,709
you know,

2336
01:19:53,583 --> 01:19:54,709
nothing happened.

2337
01:19:54,750 --> 01:19:57,709
Hey, Mike,

2338
01:19:54,750 --> 01:19:57,709
why you tripping, man?

2339
01:19:57,750 --> 01:20:00,959
I mean, we wanted to make sure

2340
01:19:57,750 --> 01:20:00,959
that you was cool with it.

2341
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:02,500
Doesn't matter

2342
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:02,500
what I think, you know?

2343
01:20:02,542 --> 01:20:04,417
Hey, I had to find out

2344
01:20:02,542 --> 01:20:04,417
like this, right?

2345
01:20:04,458 --> 01:20:05,792
Don't matter.

2346
01:20:05,834 --> 01:20:06,959
Let me ask you,

2347
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,041
y'all going

2348
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,041
to have babies?

2349
01:20:08,083 --> 01:20:09,709
Little bunch of mini Mikes?

2350
01:20:09,750 --> 01:20:12,166
Bunch of little lying,

2351
01:20:09,750 --> 01:20:12,166
violent motherfuckers?

2352
01:20:12,208 --> 01:20:14,166
Marcus, nothing happened.

2353
01:20:14,208 --> 01:20:16,583
I just want to say,

2354
01:20:14,208 --> 01:20:16,583
Mama's going to be thrilled.

2355
01:20:16,625 --> 01:20:17,959
All right,

2356
01:20:16,625 --> 01:20:17,959
you know what?

2357
01:20:18,041 --> 01:20:19,208
You need to go ahead and

2358
01:20:18,041 --> 01:20:19,208
"whoosah" or something

2359
01:20:19,250 --> 01:20:20,375
for a second.

2360
01:20:20,417 --> 01:20:21,500
Hey, hey,

2361
01:20:20,417 --> 01:20:21,500
here comes the<i> Dixie 7.</i>

2362
01:20:21,542 --> 01:20:24,083
Whoosah.

2363
01:20:26,750 --> 01:20:27,792
Mike, just leave it alone.

2364
01:20:27,834 --> 01:20:29,208
Why you acting

2365
01:20:27,834 --> 01:20:29,208
like that?

2366
01:20:29,250 --> 01:20:31,000
Hey, Mike, go on about

2367
01:20:29,250 --> 01:20:31,000
your business, man.

2368
01:20:31,041 --> 01:20:32,208
No, we're going

2369
01:20:31,041 --> 01:20:32,208
to talk about this.

2370
01:20:32,250 --> 01:20:33,208
No, get out of my face.

2371
01:20:33,250 --> 01:20:34,375
I'm trying to talk to you.

2372
01:20:34,417 --> 01:20:36,709
Get the fuck off me, Mike.

2373
01:20:36,750 --> 01:20:39,166
What the hell is

2374
01:20:36,750 --> 01:20:39,166
your problem, man?

2375
01:20:39,208 --> 01:20:40,792
Why you acting so stupid?

2376
01:20:40,834 --> 01:20:42,792
This is a dysfunctional

2377
01:20:40,834 --> 01:20:42,792
partnership.

2378
01:20:42,834 --> 01:20:44,709
That's why the fuck

2379
01:20:42,834 --> 01:20:44,709
I'm acting like that.

2380
01:20:44,750 --> 01:20:45,834
There ain't no trust,

2381
01:20:44,750 --> 01:20:45,834
Mike.

2382
01:20:45,875 --> 01:20:47,250
I didn't lie to you!

2383
01:20:47,291 --> 01:20:49,542
I was waiting for the

2384
01:20:47,291 --> 01:20:49,542
right time to tell you,

2385
01:20:49,583 --> 01:20:50,792
but that ain't

2386
01:20:49,583 --> 01:20:50,792
what your issue is.

2387
01:20:50,834 --> 01:20:52,166
Why don't you

2388
01:20:50,834 --> 01:20:52,166
bring it to me real?

2389
01:20:52,208 --> 01:20:54,041
What is your problem

2390
01:20:52,208 --> 01:20:54,041
with this?

2391
01:20:54,083 --> 01:20:57,583
You know what?

2392
01:20:54,083 --> 01:20:57,583
You a dog, man.

2393
01:20:57,625 --> 01:20:59,208
That's it. There it is.

2394
01:20:57,625 --> 01:20:59,208
I said it.

2395
01:20:59,250 --> 01:21:00,583
Oh, okay.

2396
01:21:00,625 --> 01:21:01,917
You like a pit bull

2397
01:21:01,959 --> 01:21:03,792
with that little pink thing

2398
01:21:01,959 --> 01:21:03,792
hanging out, Mike.

2399
01:21:03,834 --> 01:21:07,750
Oh, it's like that.

2400
01:21:03,834 --> 01:21:07,750
Oh, okay.

2401
01:21:07,792 --> 01:21:10,625
I'm not good enough

2402
01:21:07,792 --> 01:21:10,625
for your sister.

2403
01:21:12,375 --> 01:21:15,250
Guys, enough. The boat's coming.

2404
01:21:15,291 --> 01:21:18,542
Okay. We going to

2405
01:21:15,291 --> 01:21:18,542
handle that shit.

2406
01:21:18,583 --> 01:21:20,291
Go ahead, man.

2407
01:21:23,792 --> 01:21:28,291
In about an hour,

2408
01:21:23,792 --> 01:21:28,291
the drop boat's going to come.

2409
01:21:42,834 --> 01:21:45,959
We got them.

2410
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,917
Wonder what mortuary

2411
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,917
that coffin's going to.

2412
01:22:01,834 --> 01:22:03,083
Keep going straight by.

2413
01:22:08,834 --> 01:22:12,208
You seeing what I'm seeing?

2414
01:22:16,583 --> 01:22:20,834
Get the load to the mortuary,

2415
01:22:16,583 --> 01:22:20,834
and don't screw up.

2416
01:22:20,875 --> 01:22:22,500
I got it.

2417
01:22:22,542 --> 01:22:23,583
Load up.

2418
01:22:35,792 --> 01:22:36,792
They're getting away!

2419
01:22:36,834 --> 01:22:38,917
Stop! Stop!

2420
01:22:38,959 --> 01:22:40,709
We need your car.

2421
01:22:38,959 --> 01:22:40,709
All right?

2422
01:22:40,750 --> 01:22:42,041
Get out of the car.

2423
01:22:42,083 --> 01:22:44,583
Can you not get a better car

2424
01:22:42,083 --> 01:22:44,583
than that?

2425
01:22:44,625 --> 01:22:45,583
Let that man go!

2426
01:22:45,625 --> 01:22:46,583
Don't be coming at me

2427
01:22:46,625 --> 01:22:47,750
with that tone, Mike.

2428
01:22:47,792 --> 01:22:49,000
Freak.

2429
01:22:49,041 --> 01:22:50,792
Small cars don't fuck up

2430
01:22:49,041 --> 01:22:50,792
the ozone layer.

2431
01:22:50,834 --> 01:22:51,792
That's what

2432
01:22:50,834 --> 01:22:51,792
I'm talking about.

2433
01:22:51,834 --> 01:22:52,834
Stop the car.

2434
01:22:52,875 --> 01:22:53,917
Get...Yeah.

2435
01:22:53,959 --> 01:22:55,792
Pop the trunk.

2436
01:22:53,959 --> 01:22:55,792
Get out. Get in.

2437
01:22:55,834 --> 01:22:56,959
Get out. Get out.

2438
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:58,375
Get your ass in.

2439
01:22:58,417 --> 01:22:59,583
Okay.

2440
01:22:59,625 --> 01:23:01,208
I am in the middle of a sale.

2441
01:23:01,250 --> 01:23:02,458
Do I have to pull my gun?

2442
01:23:02,500 --> 01:23:04,792
Oh, shit. Dan Marino.

2443
01:23:02,500 --> 01:23:04,792
What's up?

2444
01:23:04,834 --> 01:23:06,417
Back up, Dan.

2445
01:23:04,834 --> 01:23:06,417
Hey, you're the truth.

2446
01:23:06,458 --> 01:23:07,458
Whatever you need,

2447
01:23:06,458 --> 01:23:07,458
officers.

2448
01:23:07,500 --> 01:23:08,417
That's Dan Marino.

2449
01:23:08,458 --> 01:23:10,583
Hey. Back up.

2450
01:23:10,625 --> 01:23:11,542
Let me know how it rides.

2451
01:23:11,583 --> 01:23:12,625
Oh, he's gonna

2452
01:23:12,667 --> 01:23:13,834
test-drive the shit out this.

2453
01:23:13,875 --> 01:23:16,458
Go. I don't want

2454
01:23:13,875 --> 01:23:16,458
to blow my cover.

2455
01:23:20,375 --> 01:23:21,750
Got them. Got them right there.

2456
01:23:35,291 --> 01:23:38,458
Mike, why do you got

2457
01:23:35,291 --> 01:23:38,458
to get so close?

2458
01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:39,959
I'm not going to let

2459
01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:39,959
that coffin get away.

2460
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,583
But they're all around us,

2461
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,583
man.

2462
01:23:41,625 --> 01:23:43,583
Shit, those are the gangbangers.

2463
01:23:43,625 --> 01:23:45,208
Relax, they don't

2464
01:23:43,625 --> 01:23:45,208
know us.

2465
01:23:45,250 --> 01:23:48,417
Boss, we got a problem here.

2466
01:23:45,250 --> 01:23:48,417
We're being followed.

2467
01:23:48,458 --> 01:23:50,959
This is a big problem, Carlos.

2468
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:52,709
Sorry, boss.

2469
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:52,709
I'll take care of it, okay?

2470
01:23:52,750 --> 01:23:56,542
You kill those black bitches.

2471
01:23:52,750 --> 01:23:56,542
All right?

2472
01:23:56,583 --> 01:23:57,750
Shit. I think they made us.

2473
01:23:57,792 --> 01:23:59,166
Get some undercovers

2474
01:23:57,792 --> 01:23:59,166
to roll with us.

2475
01:23:59,208 --> 01:24:01,083
Okay, we're splitting up.

2476
01:24:01,125 --> 01:24:03,041
<i>Everybody go</i>

2477
01:24:01,125 --> 01:24:03,041
<i>to Third and Boxter, now!</i>

2478
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,250
Here we go.

2479
01:24:17,417 --> 01:24:20,250
I didn't sign up

2480
01:24:17,417 --> 01:24:20,250
for no goddamned car chase!

2481
01:24:33,834 --> 01:24:35,000
Have you lost your mind?

2482
01:24:38,792 --> 01:24:42,333
Mike, I see you got your mind

2483
01:24:38,792 --> 01:24:42,333
set on doing dumb shit,

2484
01:24:42,375 --> 01:24:43,458
so please let me out!

2485
01:24:52,333 --> 01:24:55,125
I seen this in a movie once.

2486
01:24:52,333 --> 01:24:55,125
They didn't make it!

2487
01:24:56,125 --> 01:24:57,208
Mike!

2488
01:24:58,333 --> 01:24:59,542
Oh, shit!

2489
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:09,542
Dump truck!

2490
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:09,542
I got it.

2491
01:25:10,625 --> 01:25:11,583
Mike!

2492
01:25:11,625 --> 01:25:13,333
I'm fine. I'm fine.

2493
01:25:15,667 --> 01:25:18,709
Whoa! Whoa! Mike! Whoa!

2494
01:25:15,667 --> 01:25:18,709
Right there!

2495
01:25:18,750 --> 01:25:20,291
Oh, shit, Mike!

2496
01:25:20,333 --> 01:25:22,125
Did you see that shit?

2497
01:25:20,333 --> 01:25:22,125
No shit.

2498
01:25:31,083 --> 01:25:34,375
Dan Marino should

2499
01:25:31,083 --> 01:25:34,375
definitely buy this car.

2500
01:25:34,417 --> 01:25:36,250
But not this one.

2501
01:25:34,417 --> 01:25:36,250
I'm fucking this one up,

2502
01:25:36,291 --> 01:25:37,834
but he should definitely

2503
01:25:36,291 --> 01:25:37,834
get one like this.

2504
01:25:42,625 --> 01:25:44,583
All right,

2505
01:25:42,625 --> 01:25:44,583
that was almost fucked up.

2506
01:25:44,625 --> 01:25:45,709
I almost fucked up.

2507
01:25:50,750 --> 01:25:52,000
This is not necessary.

2508
01:26:01,542 --> 01:26:03,208
Oh, shit!

2509
01:26:06,834 --> 01:26:09,375
Dead man on

2510
01:26:06,834 --> 01:26:09,375
the hood! Dead man!

2511
01:26:09,417 --> 01:26:10,709
I'm trying

2512
01:26:09,417 --> 01:26:10,709
to get it off.

2513
01:26:10,750 --> 01:26:11,917
I'm trying to

2514
01:26:10,750 --> 01:26:11,917
get it off.

2515
01:26:14,125 --> 01:26:16,750
That shit's nasty.

2516
01:26:14,125 --> 01:26:16,750
That's nasty.

2517
01:26:16,792 --> 01:26:18,291
That shit is nasty.

2518
01:26:37,792 --> 01:26:40,750
Undercover police!

2519
01:26:37,792 --> 01:26:40,750
Everybody move!

2520
01:26:40,792 --> 01:26:44,625
Undercover police! Move!

2521
01:26:40,792 --> 01:26:44,625
Move! Move! Move!

2522
01:26:51,875 --> 01:26:53,792
Oh!

2523
01:26:55,166 --> 01:26:56,750
Coming around the corner now!

2524
01:26:56,792 --> 01:26:59,625
Get ready, they're coming

2525
01:26:56,792 --> 01:26:59,625
around the block. Move!

2526
01:27:23,333 --> 01:27:28,208
Shit! Boy, if this was my car,

2527
01:27:23,333 --> 01:27:28,208
I'd be pissed!

2528
01:27:28,250 --> 01:27:30,083
Get down! Get down!

2529
01:27:34,834 --> 01:27:36,041
Trying to break

2530
01:27:34,834 --> 01:27:36,041
the world record

2531
01:27:36,083 --> 01:27:37,709
for gun fights in a week?

2532
01:27:37,750 --> 01:27:39,875
This is not the time

2533
01:27:37,750 --> 01:27:39,875
to criticize!

2534
01:27:39,917 --> 01:27:41,083
I can't work with you

2535
01:27:41,125 --> 01:27:42,792
blaming shit on me

2536
01:27:41,125 --> 01:27:42,792
all the time!

2537
01:27:42,834 --> 01:27:44,208
This is not your fault?

2538
01:27:44,250 --> 01:27:45,625
This is not. No. No!

2539
01:27:45,667 --> 01:27:48,917
Bullshit, Mike!

2540
01:27:45,667 --> 01:27:48,917
Everything's your fault!

2541
01:27:57,333 --> 01:27:58,917
Okay, let's go! Let's go!

2542
01:28:07,458 --> 01:28:09,917
Clear around! Cool!

2543
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:16,083
I'm going around!

2544
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:21,250
Mike, got him!

2545
01:28:21,291 --> 01:28:22,709
They got the coffin.

2546
01:28:33,834 --> 01:28:36,166
Move!

2547
01:28:36,208 --> 01:28:38,375
Move! Move! Get down!

2548
01:28:36,208 --> 01:28:38,375
Police! Get down!

2549
01:28:44,542 --> 01:28:45,875
Move! Move!

2550
01:28:47,709 --> 01:28:50,125
Police! Move! Move!

2551
01:28:47,709 --> 01:28:50,125
Get out of my way!

2552
01:28:50,166 --> 01:28:51,875
Move! Move!

2553
01:28:58,083 --> 01:29:00,875
Open the door! Police!

2554
01:29:03,834 --> 01:29:06,000
Whoa! Shit!

2555
01:29:07,959 --> 01:29:09,333
Mike! Mike!

2556
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:24,834
That boy bit me!

2557
01:29:28,834 --> 01:29:29,917
Mike!

2558
01:29:45,834 --> 01:29:49,792
Move! Move!

2559
01:29:49,834 --> 01:29:51,417
Police! Move!

2560
01:30:07,208 --> 01:30:09,291
Police! Move!

2561
01:30:12,709 --> 01:30:13,792
He under there?

2562
01:30:15,709 --> 01:30:17,458
We lost the coffin,

2563
01:30:17,500 --> 01:30:19,417
and you barbecued

2564
01:30:17,500 --> 01:30:19,417
our only lead, Mike.

2565
01:30:19,458 --> 01:30:21,834
This has got to be the worst,

2566
01:30:21,875 --> 01:30:24,709
most emotional cop week

2567
01:30:21,875 --> 01:30:24,709
of my life.

2568
01:30:24,750 --> 01:30:27,709
Yeah, it's been a little rough.

2569
01:30:33,542 --> 01:30:34,875
Where were

2570
01:30:33,542 --> 01:30:34,875
these bodies going?

2571
01:30:34,917 --> 01:30:37,792
I don't know.

2572
01:30:34,917 --> 01:30:37,792
It's really strange.

2573
01:30:37,834 --> 01:30:39,500
All the John Does

2574
01:30:37,834 --> 01:30:39,500
we found out here are empty.

2575
01:30:39,542 --> 01:30:42,709
Empty Does. Fat Does.

2576
01:30:42,750 --> 01:30:44,291
Cut them open,

2577
01:30:42,750 --> 01:30:44,291
took the organs out,

2578
01:30:44,333 --> 01:30:45,375
sewed them back up.

2579
01:30:45,417 --> 01:30:47,166
Nice work.

2580
01:30:47,208 --> 01:30:49,083
The more you guys fuck up,

2581
01:30:49,125 --> 01:30:50,792
the more we look

2582
01:30:49,125 --> 01:30:50,792
like rock stars, baby.

2583
01:30:50,834 --> 01:30:52,083
The van you was chasing

2584
01:30:52,125 --> 01:30:53,792
is a transport for

2585
01:30:52,125 --> 01:30:53,792
the city morgue.

2586
01:30:53,834 --> 01:30:55,458
These John Does here

2587
01:30:53,834 --> 01:30:55,458
were being delivered

2588
01:30:55,500 --> 01:30:56,875
to the university

2589
01:30:55,500 --> 01:30:56,875
for medical research.

2590
01:30:56,917 --> 01:30:58,792
Nice going.

2591
01:30:58,834 --> 01:31:00,125
I can't believe you guys.

2592
01:31:00,166 --> 01:31:01,792
Do you both wake up

2593
01:31:00,166 --> 01:31:01,792
in the morning,

2594
01:31:01,834 --> 01:31:03,250
call each other up?

2595
01:31:03,291 --> 01:31:04,959
"Good morning, Marcus."

2596
01:31:03,291 --> 01:31:04,959
"Good morning, Mike."

2597
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:06,750
"How you doing?" "A'ight."

2598
01:31:06,792 --> 01:31:09,709
"So, how are we going to fuck up

2599
01:31:06,792 --> 01:31:09,709
the captain's life today?"

2600
01:31:09,750 --> 01:31:11,709
"Gee, I don't know."

2601
01:31:09,750 --> 01:31:11,709
"I don't know."

2602
01:31:11,750 --> 01:31:13,750
"Ooh. Look, over there.

2603
01:31:13,792 --> 01:31:18,834
Let's kill three fat people

2604
01:31:13,792 --> 01:31:18,834
and leave them on the street."

2605
01:31:18,875 --> 01:31:21,709
Hey, they were dead

2606
01:31:18,875 --> 01:31:21,709
before we ran over them.

2607
01:31:21,750 --> 01:31:25,083
It doesn't matter whether they

2608
01:31:21,750 --> 01:31:25,083
were dead or not, goddamn it!

2609
01:31:25,125 --> 01:31:28,709
Every time you leave a corpse

2610
01:31:25,125 --> 01:31:28,709
on the street,

2611
01:31:28,750 --> 01:31:32,125
I have to get

2612
01:31:28,750 --> 01:31:32,125
these forensic coroner guys

2613
01:31:32,166 --> 01:31:34,083
to come

2614
01:31:32,166 --> 01:31:34,083
and to see what happened.

2615
01:31:34,125 --> 01:31:37,500
Then I've got to get detectives.

2616
01:31:34,125 --> 01:31:37,500
See? They're detecting shit.

2617
01:31:37,542 --> 01:31:39,542
Then I've got to get

2618
01:31:37,542 --> 01:31:39,542
these forensic guys

2619
01:31:39,583 --> 01:31:43,125
to stick them back

2620
01:31:39,583 --> 01:31:43,125
in the fucking bag!

2621
01:31:43,166 --> 01:31:45,291
Jesus Christ!

2622
01:31:45,333 --> 01:31:47,166
You guys, you're like...

2623
01:31:47,208 --> 01:31:50,959
You're like a bunch

2624
01:31:47,208 --> 01:31:50,959
of bloodsucking ticks

2625
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:54,709
draining the life's blood

2626
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:54,709
out of this department.

2627
01:31:54,750 --> 01:31:55,792
Whoosah.

2628
01:31:55,834 --> 01:31:57,166
Damn the whoosah,

2629
01:31:55,834 --> 01:31:57,166
captain.

2630
01:31:57,208 --> 01:31:58,667
Did you just

2631
01:31:57,208 --> 01:31:58,667
call me a tick?

2632
01:31:58,709 --> 01:31:59,875
I was referring to him.

2633
01:31:59,917 --> 01:32:02,250
Captain, these are not

2634
01:31:59,917 --> 01:32:02,250
normal corpses.

2635
01:32:02,291 --> 01:32:05,583
If I threw you

2636
01:32:02,291 --> 01:32:05,583
out of a speeding ice truck

2637
01:32:05,625 --> 01:32:07,250
and then ran over your head,

2638
01:32:07,291 --> 01:32:08,709
you wouldn't be normal either.

2639
01:32:08,750 --> 01:32:10,083
Think about this

2640
01:32:08,750 --> 01:32:10,083
for one second.

2641
01:32:10,125 --> 01:32:11,834
All of these bodies

2642
01:32:10,125 --> 01:32:11,834
have been emptied out

2643
01:32:11,875 --> 01:32:13,125
from a drug smuggler

2644
01:32:13,166 --> 01:32:15,125
that just happens

2645
01:32:13,166 --> 01:32:15,125
to own a mortuary,

2646
01:32:15,166 --> 01:32:16,709
and I got a bunch

2647
01:32:15,166 --> 01:32:16,709
of bodies hanging around

2648
01:32:16,750 --> 01:32:17,959
with plenty of room

2649
01:32:16,750 --> 01:32:17,959
in them...

2650
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:19,792
I could smuggle some shit.

2651
01:32:19,834 --> 01:32:21,208
Johnny Tapia

2652
01:32:19,834 --> 01:32:21,208
has the perfect cover.

2653
01:32:21,250 --> 01:32:24,875
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

2654
01:32:21,250 --> 01:32:24,875
Johnny Tapia?

2655
01:32:24,917 --> 01:32:27,917
Yes. I want a warrant to go

2656
01:32:24,917 --> 01:32:27,917
into his mortuaries immediately.

2657
01:32:27,959 --> 01:32:29,834
No warrant. What?

2658
01:32:27,959 --> 01:32:29,834
For what? For what?

2659

01:42:39,125 --> 01:42:40,709
that I be

3037
01:42:39,125 --> 01:42:40,709
talking about.

3038
01:42:40,750 --> 01:42:43,041
Mike, the motherfucking head

3039
01:42:40,750 --> 01:42:43,041
fell off.

3040
01:42:43,083 --> 01:42:45,083
Come here.

3041
01:42:45,125 --> 01:42:51,375
I'm...I'm...

3042
01:42:45,125 --> 01:42:51,375
I'm back in the...game. Hoo!

3043
01:42:52,917 --> 01:42:54,375
Think I got something.

3044
01:42:55,834 --> 01:42:58,417
Feels like a bag.

3045
01:42:58,458 --> 01:42:59,792
Shit, no, it's his kidney.

3046
01:43:09,625 --> 01:43:11,750
I smell dead people.

3047
01:43:11,792 --> 01:43:14,917
Drugs and money.

3048
01:43:11,792 --> 01:43:14,917
We got him, baby.

3049
01:43:24,875 --> 01:43:26,667
This dude is loaded.

3050
01:43:26,709 --> 01:43:28,667
Bet he thinks

3051
01:43:26,709 --> 01:43:28,667
he's a damn genius,

3052
01:43:28,709 --> 01:43:30,083
transporting them

3053
01:43:28,709 --> 01:43:30,083
in dead bodies, huh?

3054
01:43:31,834 --> 01:43:32,917
Let's get this body.

3055
01:43:35,583 --> 01:43:36,583
Mike, you've

3056
01:43:35,583 --> 01:43:36,583
got company, man.

3057
01:43:36,625 --> 01:43:38,709
Somebody's coming. Hide.

3058
01:43:38,750 --> 01:43:41,000
Give me the X.

3059
01:43:38,750 --> 01:43:41,000
Give me the X.

3060
01:43:42,875 --> 01:43:44,041
You gotta stall them.

3061
01:43:47,208 --> 01:43:49,792
[ALARM RINGS]

3062
01:43:51,291 --> 01:43:52,250
Hide! Hide! Hide!

3063
01:43:52,291 --> 01:43:53,750
Shit!

3064
01:43:53,792 --> 01:43:56,333
Punk kids do this?

3065
01:43:53,792 --> 01:43:56,333
Go check it out.

3066
01:43:56,375 --> 01:43:57,542
Hide!

3067
01:44:01,250 --> 01:44:05,917
Marcus! Why would you...?

3068
01:44:01,250 --> 01:44:05,917
That's just not smart, man.

3069
01:44:09,875 --> 01:44:12,000
You tell Theresa,

3070
01:44:09,875 --> 01:44:12,000
I'll kill you.

3071
01:44:17,333 --> 01:44:19,166
Bimbo's next.

3072
01:44:19,208 --> 01:44:22,792
Oh, God. Not that.

3073
01:44:19,208 --> 01:44:22,792
Not the bimbo.

3074
01:44:22,834 --> 01:44:27,000
Let's hurry this shit up.

3075
01:44:35,834 --> 01:44:37,500
Shit.

3076
01:44:37,542 --> 01:44:39,959
We got a big problem.

3077
01:44:37,542 --> 01:44:39,959
We got a big, big problem.

3078
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:41,625
Drive that ambulance

3079
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:41,625
into the building right now.

3080
01:44:41,667 --> 01:44:43,792
<i>Crash that ambulance</i>

3081
01:44:41,667 --> 01:44:43,792
<i>into the building!</i>

3082
01:44:43,834 --> 01:44:45,875
No, no. Not me, baby.

3083
01:44:45,917 --> 01:44:47,959
I got too many crashes

3084
01:44:45,917 --> 01:44:47,959
on my file. You do it.

3085
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:49,417
No, no, man.

3086
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:49,417
You're kidding.

3087
01:44:49,458 --> 01:44:50,834
I got red-flagged by

3088
01:44:49,458 --> 01:44:50,834
administration last month

3089
01:44:50,875 --> 01:44:52,166
for the thing, you know?

3090
01:44:52,208 --> 01:44:53,542
You know how much the city

3091
01:44:52,208 --> 01:44:53,542
had to pay for that.

3092
01:44:53,583 --> 01:44:55,083
I can't have another

3093
01:44:53,583 --> 01:44:55,083
ding on my file.

3094
01:44:55,125 --> 01:45:00,166
Mike, my man, we want to

3095
01:44:55,125 --> 01:45:00,166
help you out here, you know,

3096
01:45:00,208 --> 01:45:01,834
but we got a couple

3097
01:45:00,208 --> 01:45:01,834
of administration problems

3098
01:45:01,875 --> 01:45:03,333
over here, you know

3099
01:45:01,875 --> 01:45:03,333
what I'm talking about,

3100
01:45:03,375 --> 01:45:04,583
so how about we give you

3101
01:45:04,625 --> 01:45:05,959
<i>sirens and</i>

3102
01:45:04,625 --> 01:45:05,959
<i>some flashing lights?</i>

3103
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:07,500
Make a racket. How's that?

3104
01:45:07,542 --> 01:45:10,417
Negative! Negative!

3105
01:45:10,458 --> 01:45:12,333
Crash that ambulance

3106
01:45:10,458 --> 01:45:12,333
into the building right now!

3107
01:45:12,375 --> 01:45:15,291
We want to help the team out

3108
01:45:12,375 --> 01:45:15,291
and everything, but...

3109
01:45:15,333 --> 01:45:16,917
<i>but I'm not getting</i>

3110
01:45:15,333 --> 01:45:16,917
<i>suspended for this.</i>

3111
01:45:16,959 --> 01:45:20,625
Okay, I plan on

3112
01:45:16,959 --> 01:45:20,625
whupping y'all asses

3113
01:45:20,667 --> 01:45:22,250
the second I get out of here.

3114
01:45:22,291 --> 01:45:23,834
<i>Crash that ambulance into</i>

3115
01:45:22,291 --> 01:45:23,834
<i>the building right now!</i>

3116
01:45:23,875 --> 01:45:25,959
Screw it. Just the price

3117
01:45:23,875 --> 01:45:25,959
of cop business, my man.

3118
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,208
Now, get her on the table.

3119
01:45:36,834 --> 01:45:41,083
Oh, my God.

3120
01:45:43,792 --> 01:45:47,542
What the hell? I'm so... I'm so...

3121
01:45:43,792 --> 01:45:47,542
That's tragic, man.

3122
01:45:47,583 --> 01:45:49,458
Go, go, go. Back door's clear.

3123
01:45:47,583 --> 01:45:49,458
Go! Go!

3124
01:45:49,500 --> 01:45:51,667
Get up, Marcus!

3125
01:45:51,709 --> 01:45:54,375
The gas got stuck.

3126
01:45:51,709 --> 01:45:54,375
I didn't mean to.

3127
01:46:01,041 --> 01:46:02,041
Oh, man.

3128
01:46:04,875 --> 01:46:08,834
Supple leather, you know?

3129
01:46:08,875 --> 01:46:10,250
You ever rub your leather?

3130
01:46:10,291 --> 01:46:14,250
You know, like, just rub it,

3131
01:46:10,291 --> 01:46:14,250
see how good it feels?

3132
01:46:17,250 --> 01:46:20,083
What does love

3133
01:46:17,250 --> 01:46:20,083
mean to you, Mike?

3134
01:46:20,125 --> 01:46:22,083
Don't worry about me

3135
01:46:20,125 --> 01:46:22,083
and my love.

3136
01:46:22,125 --> 01:46:27,834
Look, I got plenty of love

3137
01:46:22,125 --> 01:46:27,834
in my life.

3138
01:46:27,875 --> 01:46:29,166
Like a woman's butt.

3139
01:46:29,208 --> 01:46:30,208
Don't do that.

3140
01:46:30,250 --> 01:46:32,709
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Mike.

3141
01:46:32,750 --> 01:46:34,875
Let's just concentrate

3142
01:46:32,750 --> 01:46:34,875
and get this warrant.

3143
01:46:34,917 --> 01:46:36,792
I need to express

3144
01:46:34,917 --> 01:46:36,792
right now...

3145
01:46:36,834 --> 01:46:39,166
I want you to know,

3146
01:46:36,834 --> 01:46:39,166
if this is our last job,

3147
01:46:39,208 --> 01:46:41,917
I really appreciate you.

3148
01:46:39,208 --> 01:46:41,917
Okay?

3149
01:46:41,959 --> 01:46:43,333
No, this is not gay shit.

3150
01:46:43,375 --> 01:46:45,792
This is man shit.

3151
01:46:43,375 --> 01:46:45,792
You know what I mean?

3152
01:46:45,834 --> 01:46:48,709
And you a beautiful man.

3153
01:46:45,834 --> 01:46:48,709
You know?

3154
01:46:48,750 --> 01:46:50,417
And when you let

3155
01:46:48,750 --> 01:46:50,417
the beautiful side...

3156
01:46:50,458 --> 01:46:53,208
Wh...What?

3157
01:46:53,250 --> 01:46:54,667
Look at your pupils.

3158
01:46:54,709 --> 01:46:57,333
How am I look at

3159
01:46:54,709 --> 01:46:57,333
my pupil? What, I'm...

3160
01:46:57,375 --> 01:46:58,834
Yo, what are you taking?

3161
01:46:58,875 --> 01:47:00,792
Did you take some of that X?

3162
01:47:00,834 --> 01:47:02,083
Hey, look, give me a hug.

3163
01:47:02,125 --> 01:47:04,417
Hey, get off. Listen,

3164
01:47:02,125 --> 01:47:04,417
listen. Listen!

3165
01:47:04,458 --> 01:47:06,834
We need this warrant.

3166
01:47:04,458 --> 01:47:06,834
Do not fuck this up.

3167
01:47:06,875 --> 01:47:08,291
Pull yourself together.

3168
01:47:08,333 --> 01:47:09,625
Arr! Arr!

3169
01:47:13,875 --> 01:47:16,709
Evening, captain.

3170
01:47:16,750 --> 01:47:19,458
Hello...capteeon.

3171
01:47:19,500 --> 01:47:23,208
So, how do you two plan

3172
01:47:19,500 --> 01:47:23,208
to fuck up my evening tonight?

3173
01:47:23,250 --> 01:47:26,083
Well, captain, believe me,

3174
01:47:23,250 --> 01:47:26,083
we would not be here...

3175
01:47:26,125 --> 01:47:29,458
if it weren't seriously,

3176
01:47:26,125 --> 01:47:29,458
utterly important.

3177
01:47:29,500 --> 01:47:31,542
Get in here.

3178
01:47:32,834 --> 01:47:34,333
Get off me!

3179
01:47:40,750 --> 01:47:47,125
Ho, ho, ho, Cap,

3180
01:47:40,750 --> 01:47:47,125
this is beautiful.

3181
01:47:47,166 --> 01:47:50,250
Have such a warm feel,

3182
01:47:47,166 --> 01:47:50,250
you know?

3183
01:47:50,291 --> 01:47:52,792
Sort of like a ving shwa.

3184
01:47:50,291 --> 01:47:52,792
What's it, Mike?

3185
01:47:52,834 --> 01:47:53,834
Mike, it was a V,

3186
01:47:53,875 --> 01:47:55,250
like a von schwo.

3187
01:47:55,291 --> 01:47:56,792
Why don't you have a seat?

3188
01:47:56,834 --> 01:47:58,125
Or ven wangs, or...

3189
01:47:58,166 --> 01:48:00,333
Feng shui.

3190
01:48:00,375 --> 01:48:01,750
Von sway.

3191
01:48:01,792 --> 01:48:04,583
You have a von sway home.

3192
01:48:04,625 --> 01:48:06,125
Make yourself at home.

3193
01:48:06,166 --> 01:48:07,709
All right, captain,

3194
01:48:07,750 --> 01:48:10,542
I know you said that

3195
01:48:07,750 --> 01:48:10,542
Johnny Tapia was hands-off...

3196
01:48:10,583 --> 01:48:12,125
but, captain,

3197
01:48:10,583 --> 01:48:12,125
we got him. It's a wrap.

3198
01:48:12,166 --> 01:48:13,959
Look, we messed up today,

3199
01:48:12,166 --> 01:48:13,959
but we got him.

3200
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:15,917
Please just look.

3201
01:48:15,959 --> 01:48:17,333
How do I move it?

3202
01:48:17,375 --> 01:48:19,917
Here, you can go flip

3203
01:48:17,375 --> 01:48:19,917
through the pictures.

3204
01:48:19,959 --> 01:48:22,041
You can flip...You can

3205
01:48:19,959 --> 01:48:22,041
flip through picture...

3206
01:48:22,083 --> 01:48:25,792
This is horrible.

3207
01:48:25,834 --> 01:48:26,917
Mike!

3208
01:48:28,417 --> 01:48:30,750
Take the picture.

3209
01:48:30,792 --> 01:48:31,959
You can look

3210
01:48:30,792 --> 01:48:31,959
really close, Cap.

3211
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:33,333
Listen, we got everything

3212
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:33,333
that we need

3213
01:48:33,375 --> 01:48:34,792
to take this dude.

3214
01:48:34,834 --> 01:48:36,834
Oh, God. Oh.

3215
01:48:36,875 --> 01:48:38,709
They're taking

3216
01:48:36,875 --> 01:48:38,709
the organs out.

3217
01:48:38,750 --> 01:48:41,166
Right there you can...

3218
01:48:38,750 --> 01:48:41,166
You can...

3219
01:48:41,208 --> 01:48:43,208
If you look there...

3220
01:48:43,250 --> 01:48:46,750
Oh, gosh. Oh.

3221
01:48:46,792 --> 01:48:50,291
Oh, this is good.

3222
01:48:46,792 --> 01:48:50,291
