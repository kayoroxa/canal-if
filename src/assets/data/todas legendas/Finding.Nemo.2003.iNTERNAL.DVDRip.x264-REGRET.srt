1
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,359
Yes, Marlin.

2
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,399
I see it. It's beautiful.

3
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,079
So, Coral, when you said
you wanted an ocean view,

4
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:48,719
you didn't think you were going
to get the whole ocean, did you?

5
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,560
Oh, yeah!

6
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:55,560
A fish can breathe out here.
Did your man deliver or did he deliver?

7
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,959
- My man delivered.
- It wasn't so easy.

8
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,799
A lot of clownfish
had their eyes on this place.

9
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,399
You better believe they did.
Every single one of them.

10
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,599
You did good
and the neighbourhood is awesome.

11
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,440
- So you do like it, don't you?
- No, no, I really do like it.

12
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,359
But, Marlin, I know that
the Drop Off is desirable,

13
00:01:25,441 --> 00:01:27,279
great schools, amazing view,

14
00:01:27,361 --> 00:01:29,799
but do we really need so much space?

15
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,279
Coral, honey,
these are our kids we're talking about.

16
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,439
They deserve the best.

17
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,640
Look. They'll wake up, poke their
little heads out and see a whale

18
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,759
right by their bedroom window!

19
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,280
- You're going to wake the kids.
- Oh, right. Right.

20
00:01:46,841 --> 00:01:48,039
Look.

21
00:01:49,441 --> 00:01:51,319
They're dreaming.

22
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:55,559
- We still have to name them.
- All of them? Right now?

23
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,679
All right. We'll name this half Marlin Jr.

24
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,799
and this half Coral Jr.

25
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,239
- Okay, we're done.
- I like Nemo.

26
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,680
Nemo?

27
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:08,399
We'll name one Nemo,
but I'd like most of them to be Marlin Jr.

28
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:11,279
In a couple of days,
we're going to be parents!

29
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,439
Yeah.

30
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,959
- What if they don't like me?
- Marlin...

31
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,639
There's over 400 eggs.

32
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,759
Odds are one of them
is bound to like you.

33
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,919
What?

34
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,199
- You remember how we met?
- I try not to.

35
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,439
Well, I remember.

36
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,240
Excuse me, miss.
Can you see if I have a hook in my lip?

37
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,440
- Marlin.
- Look closer.

38
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:37,599
- Get away!
- Here he is. Cutie's here!

39
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,719
Where did everybody go?

40
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,959
Coral, get inside the house.

41
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,720
No, don't. They'll be fine.
Just get inside.

42
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,399
You. Right now.

43
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,239
No!

44
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,680
Coral!

45
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,520
Coral?

46
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,079
Coral!

47
00:03:47,801 --> 00:03:48,879
Coral?

48
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,999
There, there.

49
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,960
It's okay. Daddy's here.

50
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,039
Daddy's got you.

51
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,999
I promise I will never let
anything happen to you,

52
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,319
Nemo.

53
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,079
First day of school! Wake up!
Come on. First day of school.

54
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,199
I don't want to go to school.

55
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,999
- Not you, Dad. Me.
- Okay.

56
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,999
Get up! Time for school!

57
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,399
- All right, I'm up. It's time for school.
- Oh, boy!

58
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,559
Nemo!

59
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,279
- First day of school!
- Don't move.

60
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,719
You'll never get out of there yourself.
I'll do it.

61
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,559
- You feel a break?
- No.

62
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,679
Sometimes fluid is rushing to the area.
Any rushing fluids?

63
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,359
- No.
- How many stripes do I have?

64
00:05:32,441 --> 00:05:34,279
- Answer the question.
- Three.

65
00:05:34,361 --> 00:05:37,599
No! Something's wrong with you.
I have one, two...

66
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,479
Three. That's all I have?

67
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,480
You're okay. How's the lucky fin?

68
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,719
- Lucky.
- Let's see.

69
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,439
Sure you want to go to school this year?

70
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:52,079
- You can wait five or six years.
- Come on, Dad. It's time for school.

71
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,279
Forgot to brush.

72
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,720
Do you want this anemone to sting you?

73
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,199
- Yes.
- Brush.

74
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,680
- I'm done.
- You missed a spot.

75
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,559
- Where?
- There.

76
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,919
Right there. And here and here.

77
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:18,559
We're excited. First day of school.
Here we go. We're ready to learn.

78
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,759
What do we have to remember
about the ocean?

79
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,239
- It's not safe.
- That's my boy.

80
00:06:23,321 --> 00:06:27,919
First, we check to see that the coast
is clear. We go out and back in.

81
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,119
Then we go out and back in.

82
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,999
Then one more time. Out and back in.

83
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,639
- If you want to do it four times...
- Dad...

84
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,559
All right. Come on, boy.

85
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,679
Maybe while I'm at school,
I'll see a shark.

86
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,279
- I doubt that.
- Have you ever met a shark?

87
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,919
- No, and I don't plan to.
- How old are sea turtles?

88
00:06:48,001 --> 00:06:50,119
Sea turtles? I don't know.

89
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:52,520
Sandy Plankton from next door said that

90
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:56,599
sea turtles live to be
about 100 years old.

91
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:01,040
If I ever meet a sea turtle, I'll ask him,
after I'm done talking to the shark.

92
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,080
Hold on. Wait to cross.

93
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,559
Hold my fin. Hold my fin.

94
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,759
You're not going to freak out
like you did at the petting zoo.

95
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,280
That snail was about to charge.

96
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,079
I wonder where we're supposed to go.

97
00:07:15,161 --> 00:07:18,159
- Bye, Mom.
- I'll pick you up after school.

98
00:07:19,961 --> 00:07:22,759
Come on, you guys.
Stop it. Give it back.

99
00:07:23,801 --> 00:07:25,720
Come on. We'll try over there.

100
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,560
Excuse me.
Is this where we meet his teacher?

101
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,999
- Look who's out of the anemone.
- Yes, shocking, I know.

102
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,399
- Marty?
- Marlin.

103
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,399
- Bob.
- Ted.

104
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,399
Phil. Hey, you're a clownfish.

105
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,159
You're funny, right? Tell us a joke.

106
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,440
- Yeah.
- Good idea.

107
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:46,560
That's a misconception. Clownfish are
no funnier than any other fish.

108
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,999
- Come on, Clowny.
- Do something funny.

109
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,239
All right. I know one joke.

110
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,200
There's a mollusk. He walks up to...

111
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,919
Well, he swims up.

112
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:00,680
Actually, the mollusk isn't moving.
He's in one place.

113
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,119
And then the sea cucumber...

114
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,239
I'm mixed up. There was
a mollusk and a sea cucumber.

115
00:08:06,321 --> 00:08:08,079
None of them were walking...

116
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,159
Sheldon!
Get out of Mr Johanssen's yard now!

117
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,120
All right, you kids!

118
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,159
Where'd you go? Where'd you go?

119
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,520
Can I go play, too? Can I?

120
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,239
I would feel better if you go play
over on the sponge beds.

121
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,440
That's where I would play.

122
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,319
- What's wrong with his fin?
- He looks funny.

123
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,719
- Hey, what did I do?
- Be nice. It's his first time at school.

124
00:08:35,801 --> 00:08:38,199
He was born with it.
We call it his lucky fin.

125
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,279
Dad...

126
00:08:39,361 --> 00:08:42,959
See this tentacle?
It's shorter than all my other tentacles.

127
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:47,239
But you can't really tell.
Especially when I twirl them like this.

128
00:08:47,321 --> 00:08:49,240
I'm H20 intolerant.

129
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,639
I'm obnoxious.

130
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,479
<i>Let's name the zones,
the zones, the zones</i>

131
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,160
<i>Let's name the zones of the open sea</i>

132
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,520
Mr Ray!

133
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,559
- Come on, Nemo.
- Stay with me.

134
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,359
<i>There's epipelagic, mesopelagic,
bathyal, abyssopelagic</i>

135
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,799
<i>All the rest are too deep
for you and me to see</i>

136
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,439
I wonder where my class has gone.

137
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,239
We're under here.

138
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,879
There you are! Come aboard, explorers.

139
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,399
<i>Knowledge exploring is oh so lyrical</i>

140
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,839
<i>When you think thoughts
that are empirical</i>

141
00:09:20,921 --> 00:09:22,119
Dad, you can go now.

142
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,040
- Well, hello. Who is this?
- I'm Nemo.

143
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,519
Nemo, all new explorers
must answer a science question.

144
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:31,399
- Okay.
- You live in what kind of home?

145
00:09:31,481 --> 00:09:35,479
In an anemoninny.
Anemonemenemone.

146
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,839
Don't hurt yourself. Welcome aboard.

147
00:09:37,921 --> 00:09:39,879
Just so you know, he's got a little fin.

148
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:43,319
If he's having trouble swimming,
let him take a break. 15 minutes.

149
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,479
Dad, it's time for you to go now.

150
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,559
We're going to stay together.

151
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,159
Okay, class. Optical orbits up front.

152
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,439
Remember, we keep our
supraesophageal ganglion to ourselves.

153
00:09:54,521 --> 00:09:57,120
- That means you, Jimmy.
- Oh, man!

154
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,439
- Bye, Nemo.
- Bye, Dad.

155
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,119
Bye, son.

156
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,279
Be safe.

157
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,679
You're doing well for a first-timer.

158
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,919
You can't hold on to them forever,
can you?

159
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,079
I had a tough time when
my eldest went out on the Drop Off.

160
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,600
The Drop Off!
They're going to the Drop Off?

161
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,240
Are you insane?

162
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,079
Why don't we fry them up now
and serve them with chips?

163
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,719
Hey, Marty, calm down.

164
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,519
Don't tell me to be calm, pony-boy.

165
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,160
Pony-boy?

166
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,760
For a clownfish,
he really isn't that funny.

167
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,799
Pity.

168
00:10:33,201 --> 00:10:35,240
<i>Let's name the species,
the species, the species</i>

169
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,039
<i>Let's name the species
that live in the sea</i>

170
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,439
<i>Mollusca and gastropoda, arthropoda,
echinoderma, chordata</i>

171
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,720
<i>And some fish like you and me!</i>

172
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,640
Come on. Sing with me.

173
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,839
<i>Seaweed is cool, seaweed is fun</i>

174
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,839
<i>It makes its food
from the rays of the sun</i>

175
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,439
Okay, the Drop Off.

176
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:10,679
All right, kids.
Feel free to explore, but stay close.

177
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,319
Stromatolitic cyanobacteria! Gather.

178
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,479
An ecosystem contained
in one infinitesimal speck.

179
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,439
Come on. Let's go.

180
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,319
Come on. Sing with me.

181
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,279
<i>There's porifera, coelenterata,
hydrozoa, scyphozoa</i>

182
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,839
<i>Anthozoa, ctenophora, bryozoas three</i>

183
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,519
Hey, guys, wait up.

184
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,799
Whoa!

185
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,759
Cool.

186
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,400
Saved your life!

187
00:11:41,081 --> 00:11:42,919
You guys made me ink.

188
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,999
What's that?

189
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,239
I know what that is.
Sandy Plankton saw one.

190
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,320
He said it was called a butt.

191
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,919
Wow. That's a pretty big butt.

192
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:00,759
Look at me.
I'm going to go touch the butt.

193
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,519
Oh, yeah? Let's see you get closer.

194
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,839
Okay.

195
00:12:08,241 --> 00:12:09,559
Beat that.

196
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,039
Come on, Nemo. How far can you go?

197
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,239
- My dad says it's not safe.
- Nemo, no!

198
00:12:16,321 --> 00:12:17,399
Dad?

199
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,039
You were about to
swim into open water.

200
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,079
No!

201
00:12:20,161 --> 00:12:21,879
Good thing I was here.

202
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,280
- He wasn't going to go.
- He was too afraid.

203
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,799
- I wasn't.
- This does not concern you.

204
00:12:26,881 --> 00:12:30,199
You're lucky I don't tell your parents.
You can't swim well.

205
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:33,359
- I can swim fine, Dad, okay?
- No. It's not okay.

206
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,840
You shouldn't be near here.

207
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,399
You'll start school in a year or two.

208
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,439
No. Just because
you're scared of the ocean...

209
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,359
Clearly you're not ready.

210
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,279
You think you can do these things,
but you just can't!

211
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,119
I hate you.

212
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,159
<i>There's...</i>

213
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,959
Nothing to see. Gather there.

214
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:57,200
Anything I can do?
I am a scientist. Is there any problem?

215
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:00,319
I didn't mean to interrupt.
He isn't a good swimmer.

216
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,439
I think it's too soon
for him to be out here unsupervised.

217
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,639
I can assure you,
he's quite safe with me.

218
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,839
I'm sure he is.

219
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,039
But you have a large class
and he can get lost from sight

220
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,919
if you're not looking.

221
00:13:12,001 --> 00:13:14,679
Oh, my gosh!
Nemo's swimming out to sea.

222
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,719
Nemo!

223
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,679
What do you think you're doing?

224
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,599
You're going to get stuck

225
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,439
and I'm going to have to get you
before another fish does.

226
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,039
Get back here.

227
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,480
I said get back here now!

228
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,159
Stop.

229
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,199
You take one more move, mister...

230
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:40,400
Don't you dare.
If you put one fin on that boat...

231
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,919
Are you listening to me?

232
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,960
Don't touch the boa...

233
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:44,999
Nemo!

234
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,599
He touched the butt.

235
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,359
You paddle your little tail back here.

236
00:13:49,441 --> 00:13:52,119
That's right.
You are in big trouble, young man.

237
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,199
Do you hear me? Big...

238
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,600
Daddy, help me!

239
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,080
I'm coming, Nemo.

240
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,519
Get under me, kids.

241
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,159
No! Dad!

242
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,799
Nemo!

243
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,479
Nemo! Nemo, no!

244
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,759
Nemo!

245
00:14:27,841 --> 00:14:28,999
Nemo, Nemo!

246
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,880
No!

247
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,239
Nemo, Nemo!

248
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,319
Hold on!

249
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,239
Oh, no.

250
00:15:09,681 --> 00:15:11,720
No. It's gone. It's gone.

251
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,039
It can't be gone. No. No!

252
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,199
Nemo! Nemo...

253
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,399
Nemo!

254
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,639
No.

255
00:15:21,201 --> 00:15:23,240
Nemo! Nemo!

256
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,319
No.

257
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,799
No. Please, no.

258
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,560
No, no.

259
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,639
Has anybody seen a boat?

260
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,479
Please. A white boat?

261
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,879
My son! My son!

262
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,239
Help me. Please.

263
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,599
Look out!

264
00:15:45,201 --> 00:15:47,719
Sorry. I didn't see you, sir.

265
00:15:47,801 --> 00:15:49,160
Are you okay?

266
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,839
- He's gone.
- There, there.

267
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,519
- He's gone.
- It's all right.

268
00:15:52,601 --> 00:15:54,920
- It'll be okay.
- No, they took him away.

269
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,519
I have to find the boat.

270
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,079
- A boat? I've seen a boat.
- You have?

271
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:02,079
- And it passed by not too long ago.
- A white one?

272
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,120
- Hi. I'm Dory.
- Where? Which way?

273
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:07,079
It went this way.

274
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,320
- Follow me.
- Thank you.

275
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,719
Thank you so much.

276
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,239
No problem.

277
00:16:37,721 --> 00:16:38,759
Wait.

278
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:49,359
Quit it. I'm trying to swim here.
The ocean isn't big enough for you?

279
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,479
You got a problem, buddy?

280
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,759
Do you? Do you?

281
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,879
Want a piece of me? Yeah.

282
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,439
I'm scared now!

283
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,439
- Wait.
- Stop following me, okay?

284
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:01,479
What? You're showing me
which way the boat went.

285
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:05,079
A boat? I've seen a boat.
It passed by not too long ago.

286
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,959
It went this way. Follow me.

287
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,959
Wait a minute. What is going on?

288
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,000
You already told me
which way the boat was going.

289
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,119
I did? Oh, no.

290
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,839
If this is some kind of joke,
it's not funny and I know funny.

291
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:22,959
- I'm a clownfish.
- No, it's not. I'm so sorry.

292
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:26,279
See, I suffer from
short-term memory loss.

293
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,600
Short-term memory loss.

294
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,439
- I don't believe this.
- No.

295
00:17:30,521 --> 00:17:33,879
I forget things almost instantly.
It runs in my family.

296
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,639
At least I think it does.

297
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,319
Where are they?

298
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,839
Can I help you?

299
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,999
Something's wrong with you. Really.

300
00:17:48,081 --> 00:17:49,799
You're wasting my time.

301
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,679
I have to find my son.

302
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:55,959
Hello.

303
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,999
Well, hi!

304
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,399
Name's Bruce.

305
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,039
It's all right. I understand.

306
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,439
Why trust a shark, right?

307
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:17,639
So, what's a couple of bites like you
doing out so late?

308
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,599
Nothing. We're not even out.

309
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,879
Great.

310
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,279
Then how would you morsels like to
come to a little get-together I'm having?

311
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,399
- You mean like a party?
- Yeah, right. A party.

312
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:32,519
- What do you say?
- I love parties. That sounds like fun.

313
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:36,039
Parties are fun and it's tempting,
but we can't because...

314
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,439
Come on. I insist.

315
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,919
Okay. That's all that matters.

316
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,479
Look. Balloons. It is a party.

317
00:18:47,321 --> 00:18:51,279
Mind your distance, though.
Those balloons can be a bit dodgy.

318
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,039
You wouldn't want one of them to pop.

319
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,999
Anchor! Chum!

320
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,720
There you are, Bruce. Finally.

321
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,480
- We got company.
- It's about time, mate.

322
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:17,319
We've gone through the snacks
and I'm starving.

323
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,439
We almost had to have
a feeding frenzy.

324
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,079
Let's get this over with.

325
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,439
Right then. The meeting has
officially come to order.

326
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,079
Let us all say the pledge.

327
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,960
I am a nice shark,

328
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,319
not a mindless eating machine.

329
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,879
If I am to change this image,
I must first change myself.

330
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,519
Fish are friends, not food.

331
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,159
Except stinking dolphins.

332
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,999
Dolphins!
Yeah, they think they're so cute.

333
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:48,039
Look, I'm a flipping little dolphin.
Let me flip for you. Ain't I something?

334
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,519
Today's meeting is step five:
Bring a Fish Friend.

335
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,719
- Do you all have your friends?
- Got mine.

336
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,039
- Hey there!
- How about you, Chum?

337
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:01,679
Well, I seem to have misplaced my

338
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,319
friend.

339
00:20:04,121 --> 00:20:05,279
It's all right, Chum.

340
00:20:05,361 --> 00:20:08,159
Help yourself to one of my friends.

341
00:20:08,241 --> 00:20:11,559
Thanks, mate. A little chum for Chum.

342
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:15,119
I'll start the testimonies.
Hello. My name is Bruce.

343
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,359
Hello, Bruce.

344
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,519
It has been three weeks
since my last fish, on my honour,

345
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,800
or may I be chopped up
and made into soup.

346
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,560
- You're an inspiration to us.
- Amen.

347
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,359
- Right, then. Who's next?
- Pick me. Pick me.

348
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,199
The little sheila down the front.

349
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,439
Come on up here.

350
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,999
Hi. I'm Dory.

351
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,559
Hello, Dory.

352
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,839
And... Well, I don't think
I've ever eaten a fish.

353
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,799
- Hey, that's incredible.
- Good on you, mate!

354
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,800
I'm glad I got that off my chest.

355
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:49,920
Anyone else? How about you, mate?
What's your problem?

356
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,239
Me? I don't have a problem.

357
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,679
- Okay.
- Denial.

358
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,959
Just start with your name.

359
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,199
Okay. Hello.

360
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:02,199
My name is Marlin. I'm a clownfish.

361
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:05,639
- A clownfish? Really?
- Go on. Tell us a joke.

362
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,839
I love jokes.

363
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,999
I actually do know
one that's pretty good.

364
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,319
There was this mollusk
and he walks up to a sea cucumber.

365
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,679
Normally they don't talk,
but in a joke, everyone talks.

366
00:21:17,761 --> 00:21:20,640
The sea mollusk
says to the cucumber...

367
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,279
Daddy!

368
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,959
Nemo!

369
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,920
- I don't get it.
- For a clownfish he's not that funny.

370
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,279
No, he's my son.
He was taken by these divers.

371
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,719
You poor fish.

372
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,959
- Humans. Think they own everything.
- Probably American.

373
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:44,920
There is a father
looking for his little boy.

374
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,959
What do these markings mean?

375
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:50,759
- I never knew my father.
- Come here.

376
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,880
- We're all mates here.
- I can't read human.

377
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,919
Then we've got to find a fish
that can read this. Look. Sharks!

378
00:21:56,441 --> 00:21:58,239
- Guys.
- No, Dory.

379
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,599
- That's mine. Give it back.
- Cut it out.

380
00:22:01,241 --> 00:22:04,199
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

381
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:07,000
You really clocked me there.
Am I bleeding?

382
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,359
Dory, are you oka...

383
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,839
That's good.

384
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,639
Intervention!

385
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,199
- Just a bite.
- You hold it together, mate.

386
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,999
- Fish are friends, not food.
- Food!

387
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,479
Dory, look out.

388
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:28,319
I'm having fish tonight.

389
00:22:28,401 --> 00:22:29,639
Remember the steps, mate.

390
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,399
Just one bite.

391
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,759
G'day.

392
00:22:45,401 --> 00:22:47,799
There's no way out.
There's got to be a way to escape.

393
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,559
- Who is it?
- Help me find a way out.

394
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,319
Sorry. You'll have to come back later.
We're trying to escape.

395
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,679
There's no way out.
There's got to be a way out.

396
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:02,759
Here's something. "Es-ca-pé."
I wonder what that means.

397
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,839
- It's spelled just like the word "escape."
- Let's go.

398
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,880
Here's Brucie!

399
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:11,839
- Wait a minute. You can read?
- I can read? That's right!

400
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,359
Then here. Read this now.

401
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:18,159
He doesn't mean it.
He never even knew his father.

402
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,199
Don't fall off the wagon.

403
00:23:23,801 --> 00:23:25,519
Oh, no! It's blocked.

404
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,959
No, Bruce!

405
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,400
Sorry about... Bruce, mate.

406
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,559
He's really... A nice guy.

407
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,159
I need to get that mask.

408
00:23:37,241 --> 00:23:38,639
You want that mask? Okay.

409
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,999
No, no, no, no!

410
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,519
Quick. Grab the mask.

411
00:23:48,081 --> 00:23:50,279
Oh, no. Bruce.

412
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,479
What?

413
00:23:53,561 --> 00:23:56,199
Swim away!

414
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,639
Is the party over?

415
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,360
Nice.

416
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,119
Dad!

417
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,000
Daddy?

418
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,199
Barbara.

419
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,999
Prep for his anterior crown,
would you, please?

420
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:45,359
- And I'll need more cotton rolls.
- All right.

421
00:24:48,281 --> 00:24:49,319
Hello, little fella.

422
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,639
Beauty, isn't he?

423
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:55,079
I found that guy struggling for life
and I saved him.

424
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,159
Has that Novocain kicked in yet?

425
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,400
Bubbles!

426
00:25:05,841 --> 00:25:08,639
- My bubbles.
- He likes bubbles.

427
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:24,999
Slow down, little fella.
There's nothing to worry about.

428
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,199
- He's scared to death.
- I want to go home.

429
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,439
Do you know where my dad is?

430
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,039
Your dad's probably
back at the pet store.

431
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,400
Pet store?

432
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:36,479
- Like I'm from Bob's Fish Mart.
- Pet Palace.

433
00:25:36,561 --> 00:25:37,920
- Fish-O-Rama.
- Mail order.

434
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,199
eBay.

435
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,639
- Which one is it?
- I'm from the ocean.

436
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,680
The ocean. The ocean!

437
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:48,080
He hasn't been decontaminated yet.
Jacques!

438
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,440
Clean him!

439
00:25:50,961 --> 00:25:52,439
Ocean.

440
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,599
Voilà. He is clean.

441
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:02,480
Wow. The big blue. What's it like?

442
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,199
Big and blue?

443
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,279
I knew it.

444
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:09,639
If there's anything you need,
ask your Auntie Deb. That's me.

445
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:14,120
If I'm not around you can always
talk to my sister, Flo. Hi. How are you?

446
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:17,199
Don't listen to anything my sister says.
She's nuts.

447
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:21,199
- Can't hear you, Peach.
- I said we got a live one.

448
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,599
- Yes!
- Boy, oh, boy.

449
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,759
- What have we got?
- Root canal.

450
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,039
It's not going to be pretty.

451
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,159
- Clamp installed?
- Yup.

452
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:32,519
- What did he use to open?
- Glidden drill. He favours that one.

453
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,399
I can't see, Flo.

454
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:40,040
- Schilder Technique.
- That's a Hedstrom file.

455
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,479
That's not a Hedstrom file.
That's a K-Flex.

456
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:45,439
It's got a teardrop cross section.
A Hedstrom.

457
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,079
- K-Flex!
- Hedstrom!

458
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,159
There I go. Little help. Over here.

459
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,039
I'll go deflate him.

460
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,079
All right. Go ahead and rinse.

461
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,319
The human mouth
is a disgusting place.

462
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,599
- Nigel.
- What did I miss?

463
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:06,559
- Root canal. A doozy.
- What did he use to open?

464
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,239
- Glidden drill.
- He favours it.

465
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,359
Hope he doesn't get surplus sealer
at the portal terminus.

466
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,279
- Hello. Who's this?
- New guy.

467
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,839
- The dentist took him off the reef.
- An outie.

468
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:19,559
From my neck of the woods?
Sorry if I took a snap at you.

469
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,799
Fish got to swim. Birds got to eat.

470
00:27:21,881 --> 00:27:26,079
No, no. Those aren't your fish.
They're my fish. Come on. Go. Shoo.

471
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,839
The picture broke.
This here's Darla. She's my niece.

472
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,919
Going to be eight this week.

473
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,039
Hey, little fella.
Say hello to your new mummy.

474
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,439
She's going to be here Friday
to pick you up.

475
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,279
You're her present.

476
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,239
It's our little secret.

477
00:27:42,321 --> 00:27:43,559
Well, Mr Tucker,

478
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:46,840
while that sets up, I'm going to
go see a man about a wallaby.

479
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,479
Darla!

480
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:53,079
- What's wrong with her?
- She wouldn't stop shaking the bag.

481
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,439
- Poor Chuckles.
- He was her present last year.

482
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,119
Hitched a ride on the porcelain express.

483
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,519
She's a fish killer.

484
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:07,919
I can't go with that girl.
I have to get back to my dad.

485
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,119
- Daddy! Help me!
- He's stuck.

486
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,839
Nobody touch him.

487
00:28:24,561 --> 00:28:25,799
Can you help me?

488
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:29,080
No. You got yourself in there,
you can get yourself out.

489
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,799
- Gill...
- I just want to see him do it, okay?

490
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:35,240
Calm down. Alternate wiggling
your fins and your tail.

491
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:38,120
I can't. I have a bad fin.

492
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,839
Never stopped me.

493
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,199
Just think about what you need to do.

494
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,560
Come on.

495
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,679
Perfect.

496
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,479
- You did it.
- Good squirming.

497
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,599
Wow, from the ocean!
Just like you, Gill.

498
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,839
Yeah.

499
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,720
I've seen that look before.
What are you thinking about?

500
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:13,559
I'm thinking tonight we give
the kid a proper reception.

501
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,800
- So, kid, you got a name or what?
- Nemo.

502
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,239
I'm Nemo.

503
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,959
Nemo.

504
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,399
You going to eat that?

505
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,839
Careful of that hammer.

506
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,239
- Dory!
- Sea-Monkey has my money.

507
00:29:52,321 --> 00:29:54,479
Wake up. Get up.

508
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,039
- Come on.
- Yes, I'm a natural blue.

509
00:29:57,121 --> 00:29:58,839
- Get up!
- Look out. Sharks eat fish!

510
00:30:22,361 --> 00:30:23,799
Wow. Dusty.

511
00:30:24,561 --> 00:30:26,559
The mask. Where's the mask?

512
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,439
No! The mask! Get it!

513
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,359
Get the mask! Get it!

514
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,679
Keeps going on, doesn't it?

515
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,519
Echo! Echo!

516
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,519
- What are you doing?
- I've lost the mask.

517
00:30:47,601 --> 00:30:49,439
- Did you drop it?
- You dropped it!

518
00:30:49,521 --> 00:30:51,959
That was my only chance of
finding my son. Now it's gone.

519
00:30:55,961 --> 00:30:58,119
Hey, Mr Grumpy Gills.

520
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,919
- When you're down, know what to do?
- I don't want to know.

521
00:31:02,001 --> 00:31:04,199
Just keep swimming.

522
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,759
<i>Just keep swimming,
swimming, swimming</i>

523
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,999
<i>What do we do? We swim</i>

524
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,760
Dory, no singing.

525
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,439
<i>I love to swim</i>

526
00:31:13,521 --> 00:31:16,959
<i>And when you want to swim
you want to...</i>

527
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,879
I'm going to get stuck with that song.
It's in my head!

528
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:21,079
Sorry.

529
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,040
- See anything?
- Something's got me!

530
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,999
- That was me. Sorry.
- Who's that?

531
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:29,239
Who could it be? It's me.

532
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,839
Are... Are you my conscience?

533
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,919
Yeah. I'm your conscience.

534
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,719
We haven't spoken for a while.
How are you?

535
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,759
- Can't complain.
- Good.

536
00:31:39,841 --> 00:31:43,199
Now, Dory, I want you to tell me,
do you see anything?

537
00:31:43,281 --> 00:31:45,079
I see a...

538
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,479
- I see a light.
- A light?

539
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,599
Yeah. Over there.

540
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,319
Hey, conscience, am I dead?

541
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,839
I see it, too.

542
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,439
What is it?

543
00:32:02,201 --> 00:32:04,759
It's so pretty!

544
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,960
I...

545
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:10,199
I'm feeling happy.

546
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:14,479
Which is a big deal for me.

547
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,239
I want to touch it.

548
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,760
Hey, come back. Come on back here.

549
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:23,479
I'm going to get you.

550
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,319
<i>I'm going to swim with you</i>

551
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:28,039
<i>I'm going to be your best friend</i>

552
00:32:28,121 --> 00:32:29,399
Good feeling's gone.

553
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,559
I can't see.
I don't know where I'm going.

554
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,359
- The mask!
- What mask?

555
00:32:43,481 --> 00:32:45,479
Okay. I can't see a thing.

556
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,199
Whoa, geez.

557
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,240
- Look. A mask.
- Read it!

558
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:54,119
I'm sorry, but if you could bring it
a little closer. I need the light.

559
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,199
That's great. Keep it right there.

560
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,999
- Just read it!
- Okay, okay.

561
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,480
Mr Bossy.

562
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,919
"P." Okay. P.

563
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,519
"Sher..."

564
00:33:05,281 --> 00:33:07,079
P. Sher... P. Shirley...

565
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,599
P not Shirley.

566
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,559
The first line's "P. Sherman."

567
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:14,119
"P. Sherman" doesn't make any sense!

568
00:33:14,201 --> 00:33:15,519
Second line.

569
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,080
"42..."

570
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,679
Light, please.

571
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:25,239
"Walla... Wallaby."

572
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,119
The second line's "42 Wallaby Way."

573
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:33,159
Just finish up. Speed read.
No pressure.

574
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:36,119
There's a lot of pressure!
Take a guess, with pressure.

575
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,519
- Sydney. It's Sydney!
- Duck!

576
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,399
I'm dead. I'm dead.

577
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,199
I died. I'm dead.

578
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,719
<i>We did it, we did it</i>

579
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,400
<i>Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

580
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:00,519
<i>No eating here tonight,
eating here tonight</i>

581
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:03,239
<i>No eating here tonight
You're on a diet</i>

582
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:06,079
Dory. What did it say?
What did the mask say?

583
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,599
P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

584
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:11,919
I remembered what it said!
I forget things, but I remembered it.

585
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,959
- P. Sherman...
- Where is that?

586
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,479
I don't know. But who cares?
I remembered.

587
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:21,439
P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.
I remembered it again!

588
00:34:49,521 --> 00:34:50,880
Nemo.

589
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,439
Nemo!

590
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,399
Follow me.

591
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,239
State your name.

592
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,239
Nemo.

593
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,599
Brother Bloat, proceed.

594
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:06,399
Nemo, newcomer of orange and white.

595
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:10,719
You have been called forth to the
summit of Mount Wannahockaloogie

596
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:15,319
to join with us
in the fraternal bonds of tankhood.

597
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,239
- We want you in our club, kid.
- Really?

598
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:22,919
If you are able to swim through

599
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,359
the Ring of Fire!

600
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:33,519
Turn on the Ring of Fire.
You said you could do it.

601
00:36:33,601 --> 00:36:35,319
The Ring of Fire!

602
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,399
Bubbles. Let me...

603
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:49,640
Isn't there another way? He's just a boy.

604
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:04,479
From this moment on,
you will now be known as Sharkbait.

605
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,799
Sharkbait!

606
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,519
Welcome, Brother Sharkbait.

607
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,759
Sharkbait.

608
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,479
- Enough with the Sharkbait.
- Sharkbait...

609
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,759
- Sharkbait's one of us now.
- Agreed.

610
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:18,119
We can't send him to his death.
Darla's coming in five days.

611
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,639
So what are we going to do?

612
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,479
I'll tell you.

613
00:37:22,561 --> 00:37:25,160
We're going to get him out of here.
We'll help him escape.

614
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,599
- Escape? Really?
- We're all going to escape.

615
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:30,159
Not another one of your escape plans.

616
00:37:30,241 --> 00:37:32,199
Sorry, but they never work.

617
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,680
Yeah, why should this be any different?

618
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,999
- 'Cause we've got him.
- Me?

619
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,679
- You see that filter?
- Yeah.

620
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,320
You're the only one who can
get in and out of that thing.

621
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:46,439
We need you to take a pebble
inside there and jam the gears.

622
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:50,159
<i>You do that and this tank's going to
get filthier by the minute.</i>

623
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,799
<i>Soon the dentist
will have to clean the tank.</i>

624
00:37:52,881 --> 00:37:56,840
<i>When he does, he'll take us out of
the tank, put us in individual baggies,</i>

625
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:59,720
<i>then we'll roll down the counter,
out of the window,</i>

626
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:03,160
<i>off the awning, into the bushes,
across the street and into the harbour.</i>

627
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,719
It's foolproof.

628
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,679
- Who's with me?
- I.

629
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,519
I think you're nuts.

630
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,720
No offence, kid,
but you're not the best swimmer.

631
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,439
He's fine. He can do this.

632
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:19,519
So, Sharkbait, what do you think?

633
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,759
Let's do it!

634
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:28,159
P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.
Where are you going?

635
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,440
To P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

636
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,759
If you ask where I'm going, I'll tell you.

637
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:37,959
P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.
Where? I'm sorry. I didn't hear you.

638
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:41,119
Excuse me. Excuse me.

639
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,439
Hi. Do you know how to get... Hello?

640
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:46,159
Wait. Can you tell me... Hey!

641
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,559
Hold it!

642
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,520
Wait a minute. I'm trying to talk to you.

643
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,039
Okay, fellas. Come back here.

644
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:55,799
One quick question. I need to...
And they're gone again.

645
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:59,079
P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

646
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,239
Why do I have to tell you again?

647
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:04,679
- I don't get tired of it.
- All right, here's the thing.

648
00:39:05,561 --> 00:39:09,759
I think it's best
if I carry on from here by...

649
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,079
- By myself.
- Okay.

650
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:14,639
You know. Alone.

651
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:19,439
Without... Well, not without you,
but I don't want you with me.

652
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,439
I don't want to hurt your feelings.

653
00:39:23,521 --> 00:39:26,120
- You want me to leave?
- Well, not... Yes. Yeah.

654
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,679
I just can't afford any more delays.

655
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:31,519
You're one of
those fish that cause delays.

656
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:34,519
Sometimes it's a good thing.
There's a group of fish.

657
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,960
- They're delay fish.
- You mean...

658
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:41,119
- You mean you don't like me?
- Of course I like you.

659
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,559
Because I like you
I don't want to be with you.

660
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,719
It's a complicated emotion.

661
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:49,399
Don't cry. I like you.

662
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,559
Hey, you!

663
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,519
Lady, is this guy bothering you?

664
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:57,359
- I don't remember. Were you?
- No, no. We're just...

665
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,239
Do you guys know how I can get...

666
00:39:59,321 --> 00:40:02,880
We're talking to the lady, not you.
You like impressions?

667
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:07,280
Okay.
Just like in rehearsals, gentlemen.

668
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,999
What are we? Take a guess.

669
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,999
- I've seen one of those.
- I'm a fish with a nose like a sword.

670
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,959
- Wait.
- It's a swordfish.

671
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:16,519
Hey, clown-boy, let the lady guess.

672
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,439
Where's the butter?

673
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,679
- It's on the tip of my tongue.
- Lobster.

674
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,119
- Saw that.
- What?

675
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,159
- Lots of legs.
- Clam?

676
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,399
Close enough.

677
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,840
<i>It's a whale of a tale I'll tell you, lad</i>

678
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,079
- They're good.
- Somebody give me directions?

679
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,799
"Would somebody give me directions?"

680
00:40:33,881 --> 00:40:36,119
- I'm serious.
- Blah, blah, me, me.

681
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,599
Blah, blah, blah, me, me.

682
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,199
Thank you.

683
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,399
Oh, dear. Hey, come back.

684
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,199
What's the matter?

685
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,319
While they're doing impressions,

686
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,879
I am miles from home

687
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,920
with a fish that can't even
remember her own name.

688
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:52,639
- I bet that's frustrating.
- My son is out there.

689
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,559
- Your son Chico?
- Nemo.

690
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:58,119
It doesn't matter. 'Cause no fish
in this ocean is going to help me.

691
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,800
I'm helping you.

692
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,319
Wait right here.

693
00:41:04,601 --> 00:41:06,599
- Guys.
- Is he bothering you again?

694
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,199
No, he's a good guy.

695
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,559
Go easy on him.
He's lost his son Fabio.

696
00:41:10,641 --> 00:41:13,039
Heard of P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney?

697
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:15,399
Sydney? Oh, sure.

698
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:18,279
Ted here's got relatives in Sydney.
Don't you, Ted?

699
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:21,600
- Sure do.
- Hey, they know Sydney!

700
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:25,160
- You wouldn't know how to get there?
- Follow the EAC.

701
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:27,719
That's East Australian Current.

702
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:30,759
Big current. You can't miss it. It's in

703
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,239
that direction.

704
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,760
Then you got to follow that for about...

705
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:37,479
What do you guys think?
Three leagues?

706
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:40,520
That baby's going to
float you right past Sydney.

707
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,040
Great! That's great!

708
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:44,079
- Dory, you did it.
- Oh, please.

709
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,280
I'm just your little helper. Helping along.

710
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,519
- Fellas, thank you.
- Don't mention it.

711
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,960
Just loosen up. Okay, buddy?

712
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,999
You guys! You really nailed him. Bye.

713
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,599
- Ma'am. One more thing.
- Yes?

714
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:59,159
When you come to this trench,
swim through it, not over it.

715
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:02,200
Trench. Through it.
Not over it. I'll remember.

716
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,479
Hey!

717
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:07,039
Wait up, partner. Hold on.

718
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:10,799
Wait. I've got to tell you something.
Whoa.

719
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,319
Nice trench.

720
00:42:16,601 --> 00:42:18,599
Hello!

721
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:24,519
- Let's go.
- No, no. Bad trench. Bad trench.

722
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:28,400
- We're going to swim over this thing.
- Little red flag going up.

723
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,400
Something's telling me
we should swim through it.

724
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:34,479
Are you looking at this thing?
It's got death written on it.

725
00:42:34,561 --> 00:42:37,239
I'm sorry, but I think
we should swim through.

726
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,360
I'm done talking about this. Over we go.

727
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,799
Come on. Trust me on this.

728
00:42:40,881 --> 00:42:43,159
- Trust you?
- Yes. Trust. It's what friends do.

729
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,559
- Something shiny!
- Where?

730
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:48,479
- It just swam over the trench. Come on.
- Okay.

731
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:56,119
- Boy, it sure is clear up here.
- Exactly.

732
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,359
And look at that.

733
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,599
There's the current.
We should be there in no time.

734
00:43:01,041 --> 00:43:04,040
- Hey, little guy.
- You wanted to go through the trench.

735
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:08,359
I shall call him Squishy and
he shall be mine. Come here, Squishy.

736
00:43:08,441 --> 00:43:10,399
Come here, little Squishy.

737
00:43:13,241 --> 00:43:16,239
- That's a jellyfish!
- Bad Squishy.

738
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:17,639
Shoo! Get away.

739
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,519
- Let me see.
- Don't touch it.

740
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,959
I'm not going to touch it.
I just want to look.

741
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:23,839
How come it didn't sting you?

742
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,279
It did. Hold still.

743
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:31,399
I live in this anemone and I'm used to
these kind of stings. Come here.

744
00:43:31,481 --> 00:43:33,439
You're going to be fine.

745
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:36,680
But now we know
that we don't want to touch these again.

746
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:39,199
Let's be thankful it was just a little one.

747
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:43,639
Don't move.

748
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:47,599
This is bad, Dory.

749
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:51,679
- Boing. Boing.
- Dory!

750
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,359
You can't catch me.

751
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,959
Don't bounce on the tops. They will

752
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,800
not sting you!

753
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:01,079
- The tops don't sting you.
- Two in a row. Beat that.

754
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:02,719
Listen to me. I have an idea.

755
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,520
- A game.
- A game?

756
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,199
I love games. Pick me.

757
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:10,639
Here's the game. Whoever can hop
the fastest out of these jellyfish wins.

758
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,200
- Okay!
- Rules.

759
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:14,680
Don't touch the tentacles. Only the tops.

760
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:18,199
Something about tentacles. Got it.
On your mark. Get set. Go!

761
00:44:19,481 --> 00:44:20,959
Wait!

762
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,999
Go faster if you want to win.

763
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:25,399
- Dory!
- Boing, boing, boing!

764
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:28,319
Wait a minute.

765
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,360
So, we're cheating death now.

766
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:34,919
We're having fun at the same time.

767
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,639
I can do this. Just be careful.

768
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,319
Careful I don't make you cry when I win.

769
00:44:38,401 --> 00:44:39,799
I don't think so!

770
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:46,199
Give it up. You can't fight evolution.
I was built for speed.

771
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:48,639
- The question is, are you hungry?
- Hungry?

772
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:51,119
Yeah. 'Cause you're about to
eat my bubbles!

773
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:54,599
Duck to the left, back
and coming over, right there!

774
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:59,279
The clownfish is the winner!

775
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:01,720
We did it. Look at us!

776
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:02,999
Dory?

777
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:06,359
Oh, no.

778
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:11,439
Dory! Dory! Dory!

779
00:45:14,201 --> 00:45:15,719
Dory!

780
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:22,439
Am I disqualified?

781
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:24,519
You're doing fine. You're winning.

782
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:27,239
Stay awake.
Where does P. Sherman live?

783
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:30,359
P. Sherman, Wallaby Way, Sydney.

784
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:31,839
That's it!

785
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:37,879
Stay awake. Stay awake. Stay awake.

786
00:45:38,201 --> 00:45:41,039
Stay awake!

787
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:46,919
- Awake...
- P. Sherman...

788
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:50,000
- Awake...
- 42 Wallaby Way...

789
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,639
- Wake up.
- Sydney.

790
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:53,719
Nemo...

791
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,560
You miss your dad,
don't you, Sharkbait?

792
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:11,719
Yeah.

793
00:46:11,801 --> 00:46:15,519
Well, you're lucky to have someone
out there who's looking for you.

794
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:17,679
He's not looking for me.

795
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,760
He's scared of the ocean.

796
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:22,519
Peach? Any movement?

797
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:25,159
He's had four cups of coffee.
It's got to be soon.

798
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:26,839
Keep on him.

799
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:32,079
My first escape, landed on dental tools.

800
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,439
- I was aiming for the toilet.
- The toilet?

801
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:37,279
All drains lead to the ocean, kid.

802
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:40,239
Wow. How many times
have you tried to get out?

803
00:46:40,321 --> 00:46:45,159
I've lost count. Fish aren't meant to be
in a box, kid. It does things to you.

804
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:47,239
The bubbles, the bubbles!

805
00:46:47,321 --> 00:46:51,239
Potty break! He just grabbed the
Reader's Digest. We have 4.2 minutes.

806
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:52,839
That's your cue.

807
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:55,199
- You can do it, kid.
- We got to be quick.

808
00:46:55,281 --> 00:46:59,399
Once you get in, swim to the bottom
and I'll talk you through the rest.

809
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:00,439
Okay.

810
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:02,799
Go on. It'll be a piece of kelp.

811
00:47:10,641 --> 00:47:13,159
- Nicely done. Can you hear me?
- Yeah.

812
00:47:13,241 --> 00:47:15,079
Here comes the pebble.

813
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,399
Now, do you see a small opening?

814
00:47:24,481 --> 00:47:27,479
Okay. Inside it you'll see a rotating fan.

815
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:31,799
Very carefully, wedge that pebble
into the fan to stop it turning.

816
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:37,479
Careful, Sharkbait.

817
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:40,120
- I can't do it.
- This isn't a good idea.

818
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:41,839
He'll be fine. Try again!

819
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:43,439
Okay.

820
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:47,039
That's it, Sharkbait.

821
00:47:47,121 --> 00:47:49,279
Nice and steady.

822
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:54,520
- I got it, I got it!
- He did it.

823
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:57,680
That's great, kid.
Now swim up the tube and out.

824
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:16,439
Oh, no! Gill!

825
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:19,319
Sharkbait! Get him out of there!

826
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:20,840
- Help him!
- What do we do?

827
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:23,679
- Oh, no!
- Stay calm, kid. Just don't panic.

828
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:28,159
- Help me!
- Sharkbait, grab hold of this.

829
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:32,679
No!

830
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:34,599
- Feed me more.
- That's it!

831
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:36,719
Come on, Sharkbait. Grab it.

832
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:40,159
- I got it.
- Pull!

833
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:49,879
Gill, don't make him go back in there.

834
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:54,519
No. We're done.

835
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:12,000
Dude?

836
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:14,480
Focus, dude.

837
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:16,439
Dude?

838
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:19,599
He lives. Hey, dude.

839
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:25,079
- What happened?
- I saw the whole thing, dude.

840
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:28,439
First you were all, like, whoa!
And then we were all, like, whoa!

841
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:31,599
- Then you were, like, whoa...
- What are you talking about?

842
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:38,279
You, mini-man! Taking on the jellies.
You got serious thrill issues, dude.

843
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:39,519
Awesome.

844
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:41,399
Oh, my stomach.

845
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:45,119
Man, no hurling on the shell.
I just waxed it.

846
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:49,479
- So, Mr Turtle...
- Dude, Mr Turtle is my father.

847
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:50,999
Name's Crush.

848
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:53,000
Crush? Really?

849
00:49:53,561 --> 00:49:54,759
Okay, Crush.

850
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:58,080
Listen, I need to get to
the East Australian Current.

851
00:49:58,160 --> 00:49:59,559
EAC?

852
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:01,119
Dude...

853
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,279
You're riding it, dude.

854
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:05,080
Check it out.

855
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:27,599
Okay, grab shell, dude.

856
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:29,799
Grab what?

857
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:40,839
Righteous! Righteous!

858
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:47,040
So,

859
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:51,440
what brings you on this fine day
to the EAC?

860
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:54,399
Well, Dory and I need to get to Sydney.

861
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,599
Dory! Is she all right?

862
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:59,120
Oh, little blue.

863
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:00,319
She is sub-level, dude.

864
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:06,279
Dory, Dory! Dory!

865
00:51:07,201 --> 00:51:08,359
Oh, Dory.

866
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:12,759
I'm so sorry.

867
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:16,159
This is all my fault. It's my fault.

868
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:19,119
...twenty-nine, 30!
Ready or not, here I come!

869
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:22,799
There you are.

870
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:24,919
Catch me if you can.

871
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:36,239
Up you go!

872
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:47,559
Oh, my goodness.

873
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:51,559
Kill the motor, dude.
Let us see what Squirt does flying solo.

874
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:02,719
Whoa! That was so cool.

875
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:05,480
Hey, Dad. Did you see that?
Did you see me?

876
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:09,559
- Did you see what I did?
- You so totally rock, Squirt.

877
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:11,240
Give me some fin.

878
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:12,359
Noggin.

879
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:13,720
Dude.

880
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:18,999
Intro. Jellyman, Offspring.
Offspring, Jellyman.

881
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:22,399
- Jellies? Sweet.
- Totally.

882
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:25,559
I must have done
something you all liked, dudes.

883
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:27,160
You rock, dude.

884
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:30,639
Curl away, my son.

885
00:52:30,721 --> 00:52:32,519
It's awesome, Jellyman.

886
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:35,839
When the little dudes are eggs
we leave them on a beach to hatch,

887
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:39,719
and coo-coo-cachoo, they find
their way back to the big ol' blue.

888
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:41,799
- All by themselves?
- Yeah!

889
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:44,679
But, dude, how do you know
when they're ready?

890
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:48,759
You never really know, but when
they know, you'll know. You know?

891
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:55,879
- Hey, look, everybody.
- I know that dude.

892
00:52:55,961 --> 00:52:57,200
It's the Jellyman.

893
00:52:57,881 --> 00:53:00,559
- Well go on. Jump on him.
- Turtle pile!

894
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:02,279
Wait. Kids!

895
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:04,159
- You funny?
- Where's your shell?

896
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:06,439
- Do your stripes come off?
- I need to breathe.

897
00:53:06,521 --> 00:53:08,639
Did you cross the jellyfish forest?

898
00:53:08,721 --> 00:53:11,600
- One at a time.
- Mr Fish, did you die?

899
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:13,719
Sorry. I was vague on the details.

900
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:17,159
- So where are you going?
- You see, my son was taken.

901
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:19,400
My son was taken away from me.

902
00:53:20,241 --> 00:53:22,079
- No way!
- What happened?

903
00:53:22,161 --> 00:53:24,999
No, kids. I don't want to talk about it.

904
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:27,479
- Come on.
- Please.

905
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:29,799
Well, okay.

906
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:33,919
I live on this reef, a long way from here.

907
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:36,159
This is going to be good. I can tell.

908
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:40,199
My son, Nemo, he was mad at me.

909
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:43,479
Maybe he wouldn't have done it
if I hadn't been so tough on him.

910
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:44,839
I don't know.

911
00:53:44,921 --> 00:53:47,240
He swam in the open water to this boat

912
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:50,639
and these divers appeared
and I tried to stop them.

913
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:53,479
The boat was too fast,
so we swam out in the ocean...

914
00:53:53,561 --> 00:53:54,679
He couldn't stop them.

915
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:57,439
Then Nemo's dad,
he swims out to the ocean

916
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:59,679
and they bump into three sharks.

917
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:02,079
He scares them away
by blowing them up.

918
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:04,759
- That's amazing.
- Then dives thousands of feet...

919
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:08,839
Straight into the dark. It's wicked
dark there. You can't see a thing.

920
00:54:08,921 --> 00:54:11,279
The only thing
they can see down there is...

921
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:14,919
This big, horrible creature with
razor-sharp teeth! Nice parry.

922
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,439
Then he has to blast his way...

923
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:19,359
These fish have been
searching the ocean for days

924
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:21,159
on the East Australian Current.

925
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:23,199
He may be on his way here right now.

926
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:24,839
That should put him
in Sydney Harbour...

927
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:26,239
In a few days.

928
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:28,199
This guy will stop at nothing...

929
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:30,959
...stop at nothing until he finds his son.
I hope he makes it.

930
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:33,759
That's one dedicated father,
if you ask me.

931
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:42,520
Mine. Mine. Mine.

932
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:50,999
Would you just shut up?

933
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:54,720
- You're rats with wings.
- This bloke's looking for his boy, Nemo.

934
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:58,319
- He was taken off the reef by divers...
- There. Take it.

935
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:01,799
Say that again.
You said something about Nemo.

936
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:03,519
Mine. Mine. Mine.

937
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:07,159
Mine.

938
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:10,279
Last I heard,
he's heading towards the harbour.

939
00:55:10,361 --> 00:55:11,639
Brilliant!

940
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:26,199
Is he doing okay?

941
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:29,399
I don't know, but whatever you do,
don't mention D-A-R...

942
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:32,399
It's okay.
I know who you're talking about.

943
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:44,879
Gill?

944
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:47,479
Hey, Sharkbait.

945
00:55:48,481 --> 00:55:51,759
- I'm sorry I couldn't stop...
- I'm the one who should be sorry.

946
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:57,039
I was so ready to get out,
so ready to taste that ocean,

947
00:55:57,640 --> 00:56:00,280
I was willing to put you
in harm's way to get there.

948
00:56:01,521 --> 00:56:03,639
Nothing should be worth that.

949
00:56:05,081 --> 00:56:07,319
I'm sorry I couldn't get you
back to your father, kid.

950
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:13,359
All right. Hey, hey, hey!

951
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:15,479
What the...

952
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:18,039
Well, that's one way to pull a tooth.

953
00:56:20,441 --> 00:56:24,280
Darn kids. Well, good thing
I pulled the right one, eh?

954
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:27,679
Nigel, you just missed an extraction.

955
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:30,359
Has he loosened
the periodontal ligament yet?

956
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:32,519
What am I talking about?
Where's Nemo?

957
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:34,160
I've got to speak with him.

958
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:37,160
Your dad's been fighting the ocean
looking for you.

959
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:39,159
My father? Really?

960
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:41,000
He's travelled hundreds of miles.

961
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:44,160
- He's been battling sharks and jellyfish.
- Sharks?

962
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:47,040
- That can't be him.
- Are you sure? What was his name?

963
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:49,039
Some sort of sport fish. Tuna? Trout?

964
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:50,639
- Marlin?
- That's it.

965
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:54,159
- The clownfish from the reef.
- It's my dad! He took on a shark!

966
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:57,119
- I heard he took on three.
- Three?

967
00:56:57,201 --> 00:56:59,399
- Three sharks?
- That's 4,800 teeth!

968
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:01,559
After you were taken by Diver Dan,

969
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:03,559
your dad followed the boat
like a maniac.

970
00:57:03,641 --> 00:57:04,759
Really?

971
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:08,279
He's giving it all he's got
and then three sharks capture him.

972
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:11,040
He blows 'em up
and then dives thousands of feet

973
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:13,479
and gets chased
by a monster with huge teeth!

974
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:15,999
He ties this demon to a rock.
And his reward?

975
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:18,359
He gets to battle a jellyfish forest.

976
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:21,439
Now he's with sea turtles
on the East Australian Current

977
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:24,839
and the word is he's headed this way,
right now, to Sydney!

978
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:28,759
- What a good daddy.
- He was looking for you after all.

979
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:35,079
- He's swimming in the filter!
- Not again!

980
00:57:37,241 --> 00:57:38,200
Sharkbait!

981
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:42,359
- No!
- You've got your life ahead of you.

982
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:44,279
- We'll help you.
- Get him out.

983
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:52,279
- Get him out of there.
- Come on. Grab the end.

984
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:55,159
Are you okay?

985
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:58,119
Can you hear me, Sharkbait?
Nemo? Can you hear me?

986
00:57:58,200 --> 00:57:59,600
Yeah, I can hear you.

987
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:02,200
Sharkbait, you did it!

988
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:05,080
Sharkbait, you're...
Covered with germs!

989
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:06,959
That took guts.

990
00:58:07,681 --> 00:58:11,039
All right, we have less than
48 hours before Darla gets here.

991
00:58:11,121 --> 00:58:13,079
This tank will get plenty dirty
in that time,

992
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:15,239
but we have to help it along.

993
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:17,679
- Jacques, no cleaning.
- I shall resist.

994
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:20,359
Everybody else,
be as gross as possible.

995
00:58:20,441 --> 00:58:21,839
Think dirty thoughts.

996
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:25,359
We're going to make this tank so filthy,
the dentist'll have to clean it.

997
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:27,199
Good work.

998
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:37,160
All right, we're here, dudes.

999
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:39,920
Get ready! Your exit's coming up, man.

1000
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,439
- Where? I don't see it.
- Right there. I see it. I see it.

1001
00:58:44,441 --> 00:58:48,079
- You mean the swirling vortex of terror?
- That's it, dude.

1002
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:51,879
- Of course it is.
- First, find your exit buddy.

1003
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:55,960
- Do you have your exit buddy?
- Yes.

1004
00:58:56,040 --> 00:59:01,279
Squirt here will now give you a rundown
on proper exiting technique.

1005
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:04,320
Good afternoon. We're going to have
a great jump today.

1006
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:08,359
Crank a hard cutback
as you hit the wall.

1007
00:59:08,441 --> 00:59:11,239
There's a screaming bottom turn,
so watch out.

1008
00:59:11,321 --> 00:59:13,959
Remember, rip it, roll it and punch it!

1009
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:17,480
It's like he's trying to speak to me,
I know it.

1010
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:22,079
You're really cute, but I don't know what
you're saying. Say the first thing again.

1011
00:59:22,161 --> 00:59:24,999
Okay, Jellyman. Go, go, go!

1012
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,199
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

1013
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:40,279
That was fun.

1014
00:59:40,801 --> 00:59:42,479
I actually enjoyed that.

1015
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:43,960
Hey, look! Turtles.

1016
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:46,759
Most excellent.

1017
00:59:46,841 --> 00:59:52,159
Now, turn your fishy tails round and
swim straight on through to Sydney.

1018
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:53,759
No worries, man.

1019
00:59:53,841 --> 00:59:56,279
No worries. Thank you, Dude Crush.

1020
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:58,479
- Bye.
- See you, Jellyman.

1021
00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:00,799
Tell your little dude I said hi, okay?

1022
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:03,319
- See ya later, dudes.
- Bye, everyone.

1023
01:00:03,841 --> 01:00:05,879
Nemo would have loved this.

1024
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:10,399
Hey, Crush. I forgot. How old are you?

1025
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:12,399
150, dude!

1026
01:00:12,481 --> 01:00:15,080
And still young. Rock on!

1027
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:18,319
150. I got to remember that.

1028
01:00:19,201 --> 01:00:20,599
Whoa.

1029
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:27,199
- We going in there?
- Yep.

1030
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:29,080
P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney?

1031
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:30,159
Yep.

1032
01:00:31,001 --> 01:00:33,559
We're going to just swim straight.

1033
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:36,799
<i>Just keep swimming</i>

1034
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:38,239
Dory...

1035
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:49,599
Boy, this is taking a while.

1036
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:52,120
- Hey, how about we play a game?
- Okay.

1037
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:55,400
Okay, I'm thinking of something orange.

1038
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:57,200
- And it's small...
- It's me.

1039
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:58,280
Right.

1040
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:02,559
This one you'll never guess.
It's orange and small.

1041
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:03,599
It's me.

1042
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:05,479
All righty, Mr Smarty Pants.

1043
01:01:05,561 --> 01:01:08,679
It's orange and small
and white stripes...

1044
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:10,799
Me. And the next one, just a guess, me.

1045
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:12,039
Okay. That's just scary.

1046
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:15,079
Wait. I've seen
this floating speck before.

1047
01:01:15,161 --> 01:01:17,639
That means we've passed it.

1048
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:19,919
That means we're not going straight.

1049
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,840
We got to get to the surface.
We'll figure it out there.

1050
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:24,039
- Hey!
- What?

1051
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:26,319
Relax. Take a deep breath.

1052
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:32,199
Now, let's ask somebody for directions.

1053
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:34,640
Fine. Who? The speck?
There's nobody here!

1054
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:37,079
There has to be someone.
It's the ocean.

1055
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:39,719
We're not the only two in here.
Let's see...

1056
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:41,519
Okay, no one there.

1057
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:43,039
Nope.

1058
01:01:46,561 --> 01:01:49,279
- There's somebody. Hey, excu...
- Dory!

1059
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:51,719
I'm thinking of something mysterious.

1060
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:55,799
It's a fish we don't know, and if we
ask it directions, it could ingest us.

1061
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:58,279
What is it with men
and asking for directions?

1062
01:01:58,361 --> 01:02:01,799
Don't play the gender card.
Let's play the "let's not die" card.

1063
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:03,759
- Want to get out of here?
- Of course.

1064
01:02:03,841 --> 01:02:07,719
How are we going to do that unless
we give it a shot and hope for the best?

1065
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:10,759
- You don't fully understand.
- Trust me on this.

1066
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:20,759
All right.

1067
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:25,359
Excuse me? Little fella?

1068
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:27,679
Hello.

1069
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:29,519
Don't be rude. Say hi.

1070
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:31,159
Hello.

1071
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:33,479
- His son Bingo...
- Nemo.

1072
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:35,719
- ...was taken to...
- Sydney.

1073
01:02:35,801 --> 01:02:37,079
Sydney, yes.

1074
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:40,799
It's really important
that we get there as fast as we can.

1075
01:02:40,881 --> 01:02:42,559
Can you help us out?

1076
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:46,039
Come on, little fella. Come on.

1077
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:49,159
Dory, I'm a little fella.

1078
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:52,400
I don't think that's a little fella.

1079
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:57,039
Big fella. Whale. Okay.

1080
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:59,159
Maybe he only speaks whale.

1081
01:03:00,481 --> 01:03:02,919
We need

1082
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:06,079
to find his son.

1083
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:08,840
What are you doing?
Are you sure you speak whale?

1084
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:11,759
Can you give us...

1085
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:14,759
- Heaven knows what you're saying.
- ...directions?

1086
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:18,040
- See, he's swimming away.
- Come back.

1087
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:19,680
You've offended him.

1088
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:21,239
Maybe a different dialect.

1089
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:27,479
This is not whale.
You're speaking, like, upset stomach.

1090
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:30,159
- Maybe I should try humpback.
- No, don't.

1091
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:34,199
- You sound sick.
- Maybe louder, huh?

1092
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:36,119
- Don't do that.
- Too much orca.

1093
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:40,800
- Didn't that sound a little orca-ish?
- It sounds like nothing I've ever heard.

1094
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:44,759
Just as well. He might be hungry.

1095
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:47,719
Whales don't eat clownfish.
They eat krill.

1096
01:03:47,801 --> 01:03:50,319
- Swim away!
- Look. Krill!

1097
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:55,639
Move, Dory! Move!

1098
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:04,479
Look at that. Would you look at that?

1099
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:07,719
Filthy. Absolutely filthy.

1100
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:11,079
And it's all thanks to you, kid.
You made it possible.

1101
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:12,999
Jacques, I said no cleaning.

1102
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:14,120
I am ashamed.

1103
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:16,559
Look. Scum angel.

1104
01:04:21,401 --> 01:04:23,159
Bubbles! I love the bubbles.

1105
01:04:24,561 --> 01:04:28,400
Flo? Has anybody seen Flo? Flo!

1106
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:30,519
9:00, and cue dentist.

1107
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:33,079
Barbara. Sorry I'm late.

1108
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:35,279
Okay. Here we go.

1109
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:36,959
Little Davey Reynolds.

1110
01:04:37,041 --> 01:04:41,119
- Walks to the counter, drops the keys...
- Bloat, that's disgusting.

1111
01:04:41,561 --> 01:04:43,439
Tastes pretty good to me.

1112
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:47,159
Don't you realise
we are swimming in our own...

1113
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:49,640
- Here he comes.
- What the...

1114
01:04:51,161 --> 01:04:52,879
Crikey. What a state.

1115
01:04:56,680 --> 01:04:59,719
Barbara, what's my earliest
appointment tomorrow?

1116
01:04:59,801 --> 01:05:01,599
- 10:00, love.
- Leave it open.

1117
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:05,039
I've got to clean the fish tank
before Darla gets here.

1118
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:09,800
- You hear that, Sharkbait?
- Yay! He's going to clean the tank!

1119
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:11,679
Yeah, we're going to be clean!

1120
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:13,599
Ready to see your dad?

1121
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:14,759
Course you are.

1122
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:20,439
I wouldn't be surprised if he's out there
in the harbour waiting for you right now.

1123
01:05:21,201 --> 01:05:22,519
Yeah.

1124
01:06:35,121 --> 01:06:38,919
Here comes a big one!
Come on. You got to try this.

1125
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:42,439
- Will you just stop it?
- Why? What's wrong?

1126
01:06:42,521 --> 01:06:45,199
- We're in a whale. Don't you get it?
- A whale?

1127
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:49,079
A whale! 'Cause you had to ask for help.
And now we're stuck here.

1128
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:53,239
- A whale? You know, I speak whale.
- You're insane. You can't speak whale.

1129
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:56,039
I have to get out. I have to find my son.

1130
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:01,559
I have to tell him
how old sea turtles are!

1131
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:13,079
Hey.

1132
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:16,839
You okay?

1133
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:24,799
There, there.

1134
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:27,399
It's all right. It'll be okay.

1135
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:29,840
No. It won't.

1136
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:32,119
Sure it will. You'll see.

1137
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:36,599
No. I promised him I'd never
let anything happen to him.

1138
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:41,719
That's a funny thing to promise.

1139
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:42,759
What?

1140
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:45,239
You can't never let anything
happen to him.

1141
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:47,800
Then nothing would
ever happen to him.

1142
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:52,439
Not much fun for little Harpo.

1143
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:05,039
- What's going on?
- Don't know. I'll ask him.

1144
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:10,280
- What's...
- Dory.

1145
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:11,759
...going

1146
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:13,879
on?

1147
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:22,399
- I think he says we've stopped.
- Of course we've stopped.

1148
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:26,039
Stop trying to speak whale.
You're going to make things worse.

1149
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:27,799
What is that noise?

1150
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:33,119
Oh, no. Look what you did.

1151
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:37,879
The water's going down.
It's going down!

1152
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:44,840
- Really? You sure about that?
- Look. Already it's half-empty.

1153
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:48,799
- I'd say it's half-full.
- Stop that. It's half-empty!

1154
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:54,359
Okay, that one was a little tougher.

1155
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:57,239
He either said we should go
to the back of the throat

1156
01:08:57,320 --> 01:08:59,399
or he wants a root beer float.

1157
01:08:59,480 --> 01:09:03,039
Of course he wants us to go there.
That's eating us!

1158
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:05,719
How do I taste, Moby? Do I taste good?

1159
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:07,799
Tell him
I'm not interested in being lunch.

1160
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:10,199
- Okay. He's...
- Stop talking to him.

1161
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:19,280
- What is going on?
- I'll check. What...

1162
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:21,880
No. No more whale.
You can't speak whale.

1163
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:23,479
Yes, I can.

1164
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:24,519
No, you can't.

1165
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:27,959
You think you can do these things,
but you can't, Nemo.

1166
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:34,519
- Okay.
- Dory!

1167
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:41,080
He says it's time to let go.

1168
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:43,359
Everything's going to be all right.

1169
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:45,320
How do you know?

1170
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:47,639
How do you know something bad
isn't going to happen?

1171
01:09:48,320 --> 01:09:49,479
I don't!

1172
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:13,799
We're alive!

1173
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:17,439
Look. Syd-ney.

1174
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:19,399
Sydney! Sydney.

1175
01:10:19,481 --> 01:10:20,919
Sydney again.

1176
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,119
You were right. We made it!

1177
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:26,759
We're going to find my son.

1178
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:33,559
Thank you, sir.

1179
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:35,599
Wow. I wish I could speak whale.

1180
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:37,799
Now we find the boat that took him.

1181
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:40,559
- Right.
- Come on. We can do this!

1182
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:58,119
Morning. It's morning, everyone.

1183
01:10:58,200 --> 01:11:02,680
Today's the day. The sun is shining, the
tank is clean and we are getting out of...

1184
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:04,239
The tank is clean.

1185
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:06,559
The tank is clean!

1186
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:08,759
But how?

1187
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:11,679
Boss must have installed it
while we were sleeping.

1188
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:14,159
- What are we going to do?
- What's it say, Peach?

1189
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:17,159
I can't hear you, Peach.

1190
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:21,399
The Aqua Scum 2003 is an all-purpose,
self-cleaning salt-water purifier

1191
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:23,959
that extends
the life of your aquarium fish.

1192
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:25,079
Stop it!

1193
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:28,880
The Aqua Scum is programmed
to scan your tank every five minutes?

1194
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:30,599
Scan? What does that mean?

1195
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:38,359
<i>Temperature 82 degrees,
pH balance normal.</i>

1196
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:40,759
Nice.

1197
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:45,320
Curse you, Aqua Scum!

1198
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:48,599
- That's it for the escape plan.
- Then what are we going to do about...

1199
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:50,479
Darla!

1200
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:52,279
Stay down, kid.

1201
01:11:54,521 --> 01:11:56,999
- False alarm.
- My nerves can't take much more.

1202
01:11:57,240 --> 01:11:59,720
What are we going to do
when that brat gets here?

1203
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:02,359
- I'm thinking, I'm thinking.
- Help!

1204
01:12:02,440 --> 01:12:04,279
- Help me!
- Hold on. I'm coming.

1205
01:12:04,401 --> 01:12:05,399
Help me!

1206
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:08,199
Swim down! Come on, kid. Swim down!

1207
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:10,560
- Everybody jump in.
- Swim down!

1208
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:12,039
What the...

1209
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,039
Good work.

1210
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:16,759
- Gill!
- Sharkbait!

1211
01:12:18,241 --> 01:12:21,239
- Roll, kid! Lean, kid! Roll!
- Go to the window.

1212
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:27,840
That would have been a nasty fall.

1213
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:30,759
- I don't want to go belly-up!
- Calm down, Nemo.

1214
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:32,999
You won't go belly-up. I promise.

1215
01:12:33,080 --> 01:12:34,039
You're going to be okay.

1216
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:39,080
Darla!

1217
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:46,399
Do any of these boats
look familiar to you?

1218
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:48,599
No, but the boat has to be here.

1219
01:12:48,680 --> 01:12:51,599
- We're going to find it.
- I'm totally excited.

1220
01:12:51,680 --> 01:12:54,119
- Are you excited?
- Dory, wake up. Come on.

1221
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:56,079
Duck!

1222
01:12:57,160 --> 01:12:59,599
That's not a duck. It's a pelican!

1223
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:11,320
No! I didn't come this far
to be breakfast.

1224
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:21,399
Hey, Nigel. Would you look at that?

1225
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:22,439
What?

1226
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:25,679
Sun's barely up and Gerald's
had more than he can handle.

1227
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:28,799
Yeah. Reckon somebody
ought to help the poor guy.

1228
01:13:30,521 --> 01:13:33,199
Well, don't everybody fly off at once!

1229
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:38,159
All right, Gerald. What is it?

1230
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:39,959
Fish got your tongue?

1231
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:41,839
Love a duck!

1232
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:43,519
I've got to find my son Nemo.

1233
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:45,200
Nemo?

1234
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:49,040
He's that fish that's been
fighting the whole ocean.

1235
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:51,360
Hey, I know where your son...

1236
01:13:52,601 --> 01:13:54,599
Wait. Come back.

1237
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:57,079
- Stop!
- Keep going. He's crazy.

1238
01:13:57,160 --> 01:13:59,359
I've got something to tell you.

1239
01:14:03,161 --> 01:14:04,159
Mine.

1240
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:12,119
Okay. Don't make any sudden moves.

1241
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:15,599
Hop inside my mouth if you want to live.

1242
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:19,639
Hop into your mouth?
And how does that make me live?

1243
01:14:19,720 --> 01:14:23,720
- Mine?
- Because I can take you to your son.

1244
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:25,079
Yeah, right!

1245
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:29,360
No. I know your son. He's orange.
He's got a gimpy fin on one side.

1246
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:31,639
- That's Nemo!
- Mine! Mine! Mine!

1247
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:36,519
Fasten your seat belts!

1248
01:14:37,320 --> 01:14:39,679
Mine! Mine! Mine!

1249
01:14:57,601 --> 01:14:59,479
Everybody hold on!

1250
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,119
Mine! Mine! Mine!

1251
01:15:11,720 --> 01:15:13,479
Too loud. Too loud for me.

1252
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:15,679
<i>Twinkle, twinkle, little star</i>

1253
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:18,399
Find a happy place.
Find a happy place!

1254
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:21,559
Darla, your uncle will see you now.

1255
01:15:23,320 --> 01:15:26,039
All right. Let's see those pearly whites.

1256
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:28,040
I'm a piranha.

1257
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:29,639
They're in the Amazon.

1258
01:15:29,720 --> 01:15:33,079
And a piranha's a fish.
Just like your present.

1259
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:36,359
- I got a fishy!
- Oh, no.

1260
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:38,799
Poor little guy.

1261
01:15:38,881 --> 01:15:40,639
- He's dead.
- Sharkbait!

1262
01:15:40,720 --> 01:15:42,320
Yay! Fishy, fishy, fishy!

1263
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:46,079
Must have left your present
in the car, sweetie. I'll go and get it.

1264
01:15:46,161 --> 01:15:47,599
He's still alive!

1265
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:49,279
Why is he playing dead?

1266
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:51,039
He's going to
get flushed down the toilet.

1267
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:53,479
He's going to get out of here.

1268
01:15:53,561 --> 01:15:57,319
- What a smart little guy.
- No, not the trash can!

1269
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:00,479
Hey! I found his dad.

1270
01:16:00,561 --> 01:16:02,079
- Where's Nemo?
- Dentist!

1271
01:16:02,160 --> 01:16:03,799
- He's over there.
- What's a dentist?

1272
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:07,319
- Get in there.
- I can't go in there.

1273
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:10,679
Oh, yes you can. Charge!

1274
01:16:12,040 --> 01:16:13,399
What the...

1275
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:17,199
Darla, sweetie, look out.

1276
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:23,559
Hold still. Easy, easy.

1277
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:26,319
Hold still!

1278
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:28,120
It's all right. Nobody's going to hurt you.

1279
01:16:36,160 --> 01:16:37,799
Nemo.

1280
01:16:37,880 --> 01:16:39,799
- Oh, my goodness.
- Gotcha!

1281
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:43,200
- Nemo!
- Daddy?

1282
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,519
Out with you. And stay out!

1283
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:49,719
- Daddy?
- Fishy?

1284
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:51,560
Fishy!

1285
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:53,279
Wake up! Wake up!

1286
01:16:53,361 --> 01:16:54,759
- Oh, no!
- To the top

1287
01:16:54,840 --> 01:16:56,360
of Mount Wannahockaloogie.

1288
01:16:56,440 --> 01:16:58,639
Why are you sleeping?

1289
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:00,999
- Hurry!
- Bloat!

1290
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:05,879
Ring of Fire!

1291
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:09,079
Fishy!

1292
01:17:11,240 --> 01:17:12,839
- Get it out!
- Crikey!

1293
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:14,519
The animals have gone mad!

1294
01:17:16,801 --> 01:17:18,440
Get it out!

1295
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:20,399
- Smack her in the head!
- Go, Gill, go!

1296
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:22,359
There's a fish in my hair!

1297
01:17:23,160 --> 01:17:25,079
- Gill.
- Sharkbait.

1298
01:17:25,160 --> 01:17:27,920
Tell your dad I said hi.

1299
01:17:33,080 --> 01:17:34,439
Go get him.

1300
01:17:39,161 --> 01:17:40,559
He did it!

1301
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:43,400
- I'm happy.
- Is he going to be okay?

1302
01:17:43,480 --> 01:17:46,160
Don't worry.
All drains lead to the ocean.

1303
01:17:46,240 --> 01:17:47,639
Fishy!

1304
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:56,759
Daddy!

1305
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:33,600
I'm... I'm so sorry.

1306
01:18:35,240 --> 01:18:36,719
Truly I am.

1307
01:18:54,120 --> 01:18:55,559
- Hey...
- Dory.

1308
01:18:56,760 --> 01:19:00,439
If it wasn't for you,
I never would have even made it here.

1309
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:02,719
So thank you.

1310
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:06,279
Hey, wait a minute.

1311
01:19:06,680 --> 01:19:08,999
Wait. Where are you going?

1312
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:11,839
It's over, Dory. We were too late.

1313
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:15,199
Nemo's gone.

1314
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:17,119
I'm going home now.

1315
01:19:17,200 --> 01:19:19,199
No. No, you can't.

1316
01:19:21,080 --> 01:19:22,199
Stop!

1317
01:19:25,041 --> 01:19:27,199
Please don't go away. Please?

1318
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:30,520
No one's ever stuck with me
for so long before.

1319
01:19:31,160 --> 01:19:33,319
And if you leave...

1320
01:19:34,081 --> 01:19:36,759
I remember things better with you.
Look.

1321
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:38,999
P. Sherman, 42...

1322
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,639
42...

1323
01:19:42,760 --> 01:19:45,200
I remember it. It's there. I know it is.

1324
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:47,759
Because when I look at you, I can feel it.

1325
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:50,079
And I look at you and I...

1326
01:19:51,641 --> 01:19:53,039
I'm home.

1327
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:58,679
Please. I don't want that to go away.

1328
01:19:59,720 --> 01:20:01,559
I don't want to forget.

1329
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:04,999
I'm sorry, Dory,

1330
01:20:05,081 --> 01:20:06,519
but I do.

1331
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:21,120
- Manna from heaven.
- Sweet nectar of life.

1332
01:20:21,720 --> 01:20:23,279
Hey!

1333
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:26,200
- This is our spot.
- Go on. Get out of here.

1334
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:29,879
Hey, hey, hey.

1335
01:20:29,960 --> 01:20:31,559
Yeah, that's it.

1336
01:20:32,680 --> 01:20:34,359
Too right, mate!

1337
01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:35,999
I got a live one here!

1338
01:20:36,081 --> 01:20:38,439
- Have you seen my dad?
- Gotcha!

1339
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:41,000
- Come back here.
- You let him go!

1340
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:49,079
Dad!

1341
01:20:49,160 --> 01:20:50,439
No!

1342
01:21:02,840 --> 01:21:04,880
- Excuse me.
- No.

1343
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:07,279
- Are you all right?
- I don't know where I am.

1344
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:09,680
I don't know what's going on.
I think I lost somebody,

1345
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:11,399
but I can't remember.

1346
01:21:11,480 --> 01:21:13,799
- It's okay.
- I can't remember.

1347
01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:17,360
I'm looking for someone, too.
We can look together.

1348
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:20,719
- I'm Dory.
- I'm Nemo.

1349
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:22,199
Nemo?

1350
01:21:22,841 --> 01:21:24,039
That's a nice name.

1351
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:34,719
- Dad!
- Dad!

1352
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:36,319
- Dad.
- Dad.

1353
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:37,920
Wait a minute. Is it your dad or my dad?

1354
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,079
My dad.

1355
01:21:39,161 --> 01:21:40,999
- Got it. Dad!
- Where are we anyway?

1356
01:21:41,081 --> 01:21:42,239
Dad!

1357
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:45,279
Syl... Schai...

1358
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:46,719
Sydney.

1359
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:49,279
P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

1360
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:52,359
- Nemo!
- What?

1361
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:53,999
It's you! Nemo!

1362
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:55,639
Yes. I'm Nemo.

1363
01:21:55,720 --> 01:21:58,360
You're Nemo.
You were dead. I saw you.

1364
01:21:58,440 --> 01:22:00,680
And then... Here you are.
You're not dead.

1365
01:22:00,760 --> 01:22:03,079
And your father... Your father!

1366
01:22:03,161 --> 01:22:05,959
My father? You know my father?
Where is he?

1367
01:22:06,041 --> 01:22:07,719
He went this way. Quick!

1368
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:10,280
Hey!

1369
01:22:10,360 --> 01:22:12,279
Have you seen an orange fish swim by?

1370
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:14,279
- It looks like him.
- But bigger.

1371
01:22:14,360 --> 01:22:16,959
I saw him,
but I'm not telling you where he went.

1372
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:20,359
And there's no way
you're going to make me.

1373
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:23,919
Mine.

1374
01:22:24,001 --> 01:22:26,239
All right. I'll talk!

1375
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:28,759
He went to the fishing grounds.

1376
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:35,120
- Hey, look out.
- Sorry.

1377
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:36,919
I'm just trying to get home.

1378
01:22:40,120 --> 01:22:41,479
Daddy!

1379
01:22:41,561 --> 01:22:44,199
- Nemo?
- Daddy!

1380
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:45,319
Nemo?

1381
01:22:45,401 --> 01:22:47,159
- Dad!
- Nemo's alive!

1382
01:22:47,240 --> 01:22:48,439
Dory?

1383
01:22:48,520 --> 01:22:50,239
- Nemo!
- Daddy!

1384
01:22:50,320 --> 01:22:53,559
- Nemo! I'm coming, Nemo!
- Dad!

1385
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:56,079
Nemo! Thank goodness.

1386
01:22:56,641 --> 01:22:58,879
It's all right, son. It's going to be okay.

1387
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:01,559
Turn around!
You're going the wrong way.

1388
01:23:04,920 --> 01:23:06,959
- Look out!
- Move!

1389
01:23:27,480 --> 01:23:28,919
- Dory!
- Come on.

1390
01:23:30,440 --> 01:23:32,519
Help! Get us out!

1391
01:23:33,240 --> 01:23:35,479
No, no, no! Dory!

1392
01:23:35,560 --> 01:23:37,640
- Dad, I know what to do.
- Nemo, no!

1393
01:23:37,720 --> 01:23:40,359
We have to tell all the fish
to swim down together.

1394
01:23:40,440 --> 01:23:42,599
- Get out of there.
- This will work.

1395
01:23:42,680 --> 01:23:44,879
No, I am not going to lose you again.

1396
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:48,200
There's no time.
It's the only way we can save Dory.

1397
01:23:49,680 --> 01:23:50,839
I can do this!

1398
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:55,799
You're right. I know you can.

1399
01:23:56,161 --> 01:23:59,079
- Lucky fin.
- Now, go. Hurry!

1400
01:23:59,160 --> 01:24:01,359
Tell all the fish to swim down.

1401
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:04,599
Well, you heard my son. Come on.

1402
01:24:06,360 --> 01:24:10,439
- Dory, you have to tell everybody to...
- Swim down together.

1403
01:24:10,520 --> 01:24:12,639
Do you understand what I'm saying?

1404
01:24:12,720 --> 01:24:14,439
Swim down!

1405
01:24:18,680 --> 01:24:22,279
- Everybody swim down.
- Come on. You have to swim down.

1406
01:24:22,361 --> 01:24:24,919
Down! Swim down!

1407
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:30,399
Swim down! Swim down!

1408
01:24:38,040 --> 01:24:40,159
Don't give up! Keep swimming!

1409
01:24:41,240 --> 01:24:42,999
Just keep swimming!

1410
01:24:47,160 --> 01:24:48,119
That's it!

1411
01:24:51,560 --> 01:24:52,839
It's working!

1412
01:24:55,560 --> 01:24:58,560
Keep swimming!

1413
01:24:58,640 --> 01:25:01,079
Just keep swimming!

1414
01:25:01,160 --> 01:25:03,279
- Come on, Dad!
- You're doing great, son.

1415
01:25:03,361 --> 01:25:05,599
- That's my dad.
- Let's get to the bottom.

1416
01:25:06,680 --> 01:25:08,759
<i>Just keep swimming</i>

1417
01:25:08,840 --> 01:25:10,879
Almost there. Keep swimming!

1418
01:25:14,360 --> 01:25:18,879
Keep swimming!

1419
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:30,920
Hey!

1420
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:32,440
Where's Nemo?

1421
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:33,839
There!

1422
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:38,200
Oh, no. Nemo!

1423
01:25:44,921 --> 01:25:48,679
Nemo?

1424
01:25:50,360 --> 01:25:53,239
It's okay. Daddy's here.
Daddy's got you.

1425
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:00,599
- Daddy?
- Oh, thank goodness.

1426
01:26:00,680 --> 01:26:02,359
Daddy...

1427
01:26:02,440 --> 01:26:05,080
- I don't hate you.
- Oh, no, no, no.

1428
01:26:06,160 --> 01:26:08,439
I'm so sorry, Nemo.

1429
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:19,719
Hey, guess what?

1430
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:22,080
- What?
- Sea turtles...

1431
01:26:22,160 --> 01:26:23,959
I met one.

1432
01:26:24,040 --> 01:26:27,679
And he was 150 years old.

1433
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:29,639
150?

1434
01:26:29,720 --> 01:26:31,159
Yep.

1435
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:35,719
'Cause Sandy Plankton said
they only lived to be 100.

1436
01:26:36,640 --> 01:26:38,039
Sandy Plankton?

1437
01:26:38,120 --> 01:26:41,799
Think I would cross the ocean and
not know as much as Sandy Plankton?

1438
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:44,519
He was 150! Not 100.

1439
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:47,799
Who is this Sandy Plankton
that knows everything wrong?

1440
01:26:50,040 --> 01:26:53,239
Time for school! Time for school!
Get up! Let's go!

1441
01:26:54,160 --> 01:26:56,879
- I'm going to win.
- No, you're not.

1442
01:26:56,960 --> 01:27:00,359
- I did it.
- My own son beats me.

1443
01:27:00,440 --> 01:27:02,400
Climb aboard, explorers.

1444
01:27:02,480 --> 01:27:05,639
So then the sea cucumber looks over
at the mollusk and says,

1445
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:08,119
"With fronds like these,
who needs anemones?"

1446
01:27:10,280 --> 01:27:12,000
Well, hello, Nemo. Who's this?

1447
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:15,279
- Exchange student.
- I'm from the EAC, dude.

1448
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:17,559
- Sweet.
- Totally.

1449
01:27:18,440 --> 01:27:21,999
Seriously, Marty, did you really do
all the things you say you did?

1450
01:27:22,080 --> 01:27:23,319
Pardon me.

1451
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:25,199
Hello.

1452
01:27:26,681 --> 01:27:28,159
Don't be alarmed.

1453
01:27:28,240 --> 01:27:31,239
We wanted to make sure
our newest member got home safely.

1454
01:27:31,320 --> 01:27:33,319
- Thanks.
- We'll see you next week.

1455
01:27:33,401 --> 01:27:36,799
- Keep up with the programme, Dory.
- Remember, fish are friends.

1456
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:39,119
Not food! Bye!

1457
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:40,999
Hold on. Here we go.

1458
01:27:41,081 --> 01:27:42,720
Next stop, knowledge.

1459
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:45,159
Bye, son. Have fun.

1460
01:27:45,240 --> 01:27:46,319
Bye, Dad.

1461
01:27:47,320 --> 01:27:49,559
Mr Ray, wait. I forgot something.

1462
01:27:54,521 --> 01:27:56,119
Love you, Dad.

1463
01:27:57,280 --> 01:27:59,199
I love you, too, son.

1464
01:28:01,880 --> 01:28:04,199
Dad? You can let go now.

1465
01:28:04,280 --> 01:28:05,559
Sorry.

1466
01:28:05,640 --> 01:28:07,680
Now go have an adventure.

1467
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:09,959
Goodbye. See you later, dudes!

1468
01:28:10,040 --> 01:28:11,719
- Bye, Elmo.
- Nemo.

1469
01:28:11,801 --> 01:28:15,159
- Nemo. Bye, Nemo.
- See you after school, Dory.

1470
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:17,239
Bye, Dad!

1471
01:28:18,680 --> 01:28:20,119
Bye, son.

1472
01:28:37,320 --> 01:28:38,439
Barbara.

1473
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:39,920
I don't understand it.

1474
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:43,159
Here this thing has a lifetime guarantee
and it breaks.

1475
01:28:43,240 --> 01:28:47,639
Had to clean the tank myself,
take the fish out, put 'em in bags and...

1476
01:28:48,120 --> 01:28:49,879
Where'd the fish go?

1477
01:28:55,120 --> 01:28:57,320
Come on, Peach!

1478
01:28:57,400 --> 01:28:59,759
You got it. That's it. You can do it.

1479
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:02,000
That's the shortest red light
I've ever seen.

1480
01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:03,759
Come on, Peach.

1481
01:29:13,241 --> 01:36:04,479
Now what?
