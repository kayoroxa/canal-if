00:00:49,073 --> 00:00:50,783
Huh?

2
00:00:50,867 --> 00:00:52,744
Oh.

3
00:00:52,827 --> 00:00:54,912
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

4
00:01:11,262 --> 00:01:14,265
- Aloha.
- What?

5
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:17,768
Bye-bye.

6
00:01:40,416 --> 00:01:43,002
Stitch, why are you doing this?

7
00:01:44,587 --> 00:01:46,088
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha!

8
00:01:46,171 --> 00:01:47,923
Please stop.

9
00:01:59,018 --> 00:02:01,103
Stop it, Stitch. Don't...

10
00:02:03,897 --> 00:02:06,442
No! Stitch!

11
00:02:06,525 --> 00:02:09,695
Wake up! Wake up!

12
00:02:09,778 --> 00:02:12,197
Wake up, Stitch. Wake up.

13
00:02:12,281 --> 00:02:14,658
Stitch, wake up.

14
00:02:14,741 --> 00:02:18,328
It's all right. Don't worry.

15
00:02:18,412 --> 00:02:21,540
You were just having
another nightmare.

16
00:02:21,623 --> 00:02:25,210
Seems like a bad one.

17
00:02:25,294 --> 00:02:27,504
You know what this means,
don't you?

18
00:02:27,588 --> 00:02:31,258
Hmm, very interesting.

19
00:02:31,341 --> 00:02:33,719
Why don't you tell me
what happened next?

20
00:02:33,802 --> 00:02:37,514
Well...

21
00:02:37,597 --> 00:02:39,641
Mmm, I see.

22
00:02:39,725 --> 00:02:41,643
Then...

23
00:02:41,727 --> 00:02:43,812
And then...

24
00:02:43,895 --> 00:02:46,189
And then...

25
00:02:46,273 --> 00:02:49,192
That's it. No more.

26
00:02:49,276 --> 00:02:51,153
It's my professional opinion

27
00:02:51,236 --> 00:02:54,447
that you're afraid
of turning bad again.

28
00:02:54,531 --> 00:02:56,908
We need to test your goodness level.

29
00:02:56,992 --> 00:03:01,580
<i>For example, someone bad would
let this Elvis Blue Hawaii lamp,</i>

30
00:03:01,663 --> 00:03:05,959
circa 1971, smash to pieces
against that wall.

31
00:03:07,043 --> 00:03:09,421
Or let my favorite book,

32
00:03:09,504 --> 00:03:11,464
<i>Plastic Surgeries Gone Wrong,</i>

33
00:03:11,548 --> 00:03:14,134
drop out this window
to be lost forever.

34
00:03:14,217 --> 00:03:16,302
Yah! Waagh!

35
00:03:18,138 --> 00:03:22,934
Or let his family member
fall to her painful, crushing death.

36
00:03:23,017 --> 00:03:25,311
No!

37
00:03:25,395 --> 00:03:28,898
See?
Look at all the good things you did.

38
00:03:28,982 --> 00:03:33,278
My prognosis?
Your goodness level is extra high.

39
00:03:33,361 --> 00:03:35,446
Nothing to worry about.

40
00:03:37,574 --> 00:03:40,743
Lilo! Stitch!
You're gonna be late for hula class.

41
00:03:40,827 --> 00:03:42,328
Except that.

42
00:03:46,499 --> 00:03:48,584
Stitch!

43
00:03:49,502 --> 00:03:51,379
Hurry up, you two.

44
00:03:51,462 --> 00:03:55,174
Hey, can you guys help me today?
It's family night.

45
00:03:55,258 --> 00:03:57,760
- I want the house clean.
- Oh, not me.

46
00:03:57,844 --> 00:04:01,305
I have very important project
I've been working on.

47
00:04:01,389 --> 00:04:03,349
- No more crop circles!
- Ah!

48
00:04:03,433 --> 00:04:06,894
Oh... All the other aliens
get to make them.

49
00:04:06,978 --> 00:04:11,065
- What about you?
- I have a full day of Earth research.

50
00:04:11,148 --> 00:04:13,776
Watching talk shows
and reading magazines?

51
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,736
Yeah, it takes it out of ya.

52
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:18,072
Can we take the hovercraft? Please?

53
00:04:18,155 --> 00:04:20,074
It's too dangerous.

54
00:04:20,157 --> 00:04:24,036
- Besides, someone may see you.
- Please?

55
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:28,290
All right, you can take it
if you can find it.

56
00:04:28,374 --> 00:04:29,917
Yes!

57
00:04:30,001 --> 00:04:32,503
I hid it so good this time,
they're never...

58
00:04:32,586 --> 00:04:34,588
Thanks, Nani.

59
00:04:34,672 --> 00:04:38,676
Aw! I gotta find
a better hiding place for that thing.

60
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:42,888
Whoa! Whoa!

61
00:04:50,771 --> 00:04:52,690
Oops. Sorry!

62
00:05:32,145 --> 00:05:35,274
Girls, I have very exciting news.

63
00:05:35,357 --> 00:05:37,859
This week is our May Day celeb...

64
00:05:37,943 --> 00:05:40,654
Sorry I'm late.
But wait till you see this.

65
00:05:40,737 --> 00:05:42,948
<i>I got my uliuli technique down.</i>

66
00:05:43,031 --> 00:05:45,951
<i>- Lilo...
- Kui kala laima!</i>

67
00:05:46,034 --> 00:05:48,120
<i>Ho kee ma!</i>

68
00:05:48,203 --> 00:05:50,247
<i>Uliuli, uliuli, ha!</i>

69
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:52,541
<i>- Lilo?
- Uliuli, uliuli, ha!</i>

70
00:05:52,624 --> 00:05:54,626
<i>Uliuli, uliuli, ha!</i>

71
00:05:54,709 --> 00:05:56,920
Lilo, we're not doing that today.

72
00:05:57,003 --> 00:05:59,089
We're not doing that today.

73
00:06:00,715 --> 00:06:02,884
Nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah,
nyah-nyah-nyah.

74
00:06:02,968 --> 00:06:04,261
Bleugh!

75
00:06:06,263 --> 00:06:08,098
Kumu has an announcement.

76
00:06:08,181 --> 00:06:13,103
In three days
is our town's May Day celebration.

77
00:06:13,186 --> 00:06:15,146
And here's the best part.

78
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:17,440
There will be a hula competition.

79
00:06:17,524 --> 00:06:20,485
Each of you
will create an original hula.

80
00:06:20,568 --> 00:06:25,156
The one that best expresses
the aloha spirit will lead our hulau

81
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,284
- as the winning dance.
- You, you, you!

82
00:06:28,368 --> 00:06:31,371
- Are there any questions?
- Kumu, I have one.

83
00:06:31,454 --> 00:06:35,375
Will people who are late to class
be allowed to participate?

84
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:40,088
Mertle, I think in the spirit of aloha
we should be tolerant of others.

85
00:06:40,171 --> 00:06:42,215
Well, there's no harm in asking.

86
00:06:42,298 --> 00:06:44,717
I want you to use class time today

87
00:06:44,801 --> 00:06:48,054
to begin working on your ideas.

88
00:06:48,137 --> 00:06:50,348
The May Day celebration is big time.

89
00:06:50,431 --> 00:06:52,267
The whole town will be there.

90
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:54,727
Maybe I'll get a contract.

91
00:06:54,811 --> 00:06:58,314
We can do any idea we want.
Even make our own costumes.

92
00:06:58,398 --> 00:07:00,274
- Cool!
- It'll be a lotta work.

93
00:07:00,358 --> 00:07:02,777
My mom knows
how to make great costumes.

94
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:06,531
- My mom can sew really good.
- My mom knows a lot about hula.

95
00:07:06,614 --> 00:07:09,659
- She can help me with it.
- I guess Lilo's on her own.

96
00:07:09,742 --> 00:07:12,245
- She doesn't have a mom.
- Don't say that.

97
00:07:12,328 --> 00:07:14,914
- It's the truth.
- Not everyone has a mom.

98
00:07:14,997 --> 00:07:17,208
All right, don't bite my head off.

99
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:19,835
I don't know
what costume I'm gonna wear.

100
00:07:21,045 --> 00:07:23,839
Lilo, may I speak with you?

101
00:07:27,051 --> 00:07:29,845
This is a book of past winners.

102
00:07:29,929 --> 00:07:31,973
Do you know who this is?

103
00:07:33,265 --> 00:07:35,101
It's your mother.

104
00:07:35,184 --> 00:07:37,019
My mom?

105
00:07:37,103 --> 00:07:40,398
Aye. She won the competition
when she was your age.

106
00:07:40,481 --> 00:07:43,567
She was as beautiful as an orchid

107
00:07:43,651 --> 00:07:47,071
and as graceful as a rolling wave.

108
00:07:48,322 --> 00:07:50,783
Here. To inspire you.

109
00:07:53,577 --> 00:07:55,621
Mmm.

110
00:07:55,704 --> 00:07:57,456
That's my mom.

111
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:00,876
She won the competition
when she was my age.

112
00:08:04,171 --> 00:08:06,048
Yay!

113
00:08:08,384 --> 00:08:12,554
Hey, Lilo.
Maybe your dog can take a picture of me

114
00:08:12,638 --> 00:08:15,057
when I win the competition.

115
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:18,227
- How do you know you'll win?
- It's pretty well known

116
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:21,855
that I'm the best dancer
in the seven-year-old division.

117
00:08:21,939 --> 00:08:25,150
I don't know.
I think maybe I can win.

118
00:08:25,234 --> 00:08:27,444
Hello? You're a stinky dancer,

119
00:08:27,528 --> 00:08:30,239
and anything you come up with
will be stinky.

120
00:08:30,322 --> 00:08:32,491
- Oh!
- Uh-uh.

121
00:08:32,574 --> 00:08:36,036
You'll never be like your mom. Never.

122
00:08:37,287 --> 00:08:39,581
- OK.
- That's it!

123
00:08:39,665 --> 00:08:41,166
Smile.

124
00:08:48,382 --> 00:08:53,720
As you can see, there was
a little disagreement... again.

125
00:08:53,804 --> 00:08:55,013
Ai-ya.

126
00:08:55,097 --> 00:08:57,140
Next time, flush the evidence.

127
00:08:57,224 --> 00:08:58,892
Ka-shush.

128
00:08:58,975 --> 00:09:02,270
Why don't you come inside, Kumu.
Excuse the mess.

129
00:09:02,354 --> 00:09:05,690
- Ooh-we.
- We have a full house.

130
00:09:05,774 --> 00:09:09,736
Make yourself at home, Kumu.
I just made some lemonade.

131
00:09:09,819 --> 00:09:11,696
- Wha...
- Hey!

132
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,532
Nani, we're out of lemonade.

133
00:09:13,615 --> 00:09:16,451
Pleakley, I just made that.

134
00:09:16,534 --> 00:09:19,537
Nani. You have to come to lab
and see my new invention.

135
00:09:19,621 --> 00:09:21,539
I just mopped in here!

136
00:09:21,623 --> 00:09:24,292
It will improve
your primitive earthly life.

137
00:09:24,376 --> 00:09:28,755
Speaking of improving your life,
I've just been reading this article

138
00:09:28,838 --> 00:09:30,924
<i>called Ten Days To A Slimmer You. </i>

139
00:09:31,007 --> 00:09:33,009
Full of wonderful suggestions.

140
00:09:33,093 --> 00:09:36,262
Guys, I don't have time for this.
We have a guest.

141
00:09:36,346 --> 00:09:38,848
A guest?
Well, let's go meet him.

142
00:09:38,932 --> 00:09:42,227
Let's not.
Lilo's in enough trouble.

143
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:45,021
- Trouble?
- Well, all out of lemonade.

144
00:09:45,104 --> 00:09:50,944
Anyway, I know my sister
is very sorry and didn't mean it.

145
00:09:51,027 --> 00:09:52,946
- Very sorry.
- See?

146
00:09:53,029 --> 00:09:54,739
- But I did mean it.
- Lilo?

147
00:09:54,822 --> 00:09:58,201
Next time,
Mertle Edmunds is going down.

148
00:09:58,284 --> 00:10:00,203
She's going way down.

149
00:10:02,497 --> 00:10:04,290
No more pro wrestling for you.

150
00:10:04,374 --> 00:10:08,211
Where is she? Where is she?

151
00:10:08,294 --> 00:10:10,338
<i>- Wow.
- Ai-kapulu. </i>

152
00:10:10,421 --> 00:10:14,884
There's our precious angel, who must be
the victim of a misunderstanding.

153
00:10:14,967 --> 00:10:16,928
- Oh, no, no...
- Where is she?

154
00:10:17,011 --> 00:10:20,890
- Jumba. What are you doing?
- Don't worry. The cavalry has arrived.

155
00:10:20,973 --> 00:10:23,017
- There she is.
- No, no, no, no.

156
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,854
Somebody give this kid gold star,
she's so good.

157
00:10:26,938 --> 00:10:28,648
I don't believe we've met.

158
00:10:28,731 --> 00:10:33,069
This is Uncle Jumba
and I'm Auntie Pleakley. Enchanté.

159
00:10:33,152 --> 00:10:36,322
On second thought, Kumu,
we should talk outside.

160
00:10:36,405 --> 00:10:38,949
It's not polite
to interrupt your auntie.

161
00:10:39,033 --> 00:10:40,284
- Knock, knock.
- David.

162
00:10:40,368 --> 00:10:43,245
How's it, every... body?

163
00:10:43,329 --> 00:10:47,124
You remember my Auntie Pleakley
and Uncle Jumba, right?

164
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:48,250
Uh...

165
00:10:48,334 --> 00:10:51,504
- Say something.
- Uh...

166
00:10:51,587 --> 00:10:54,423
- Nice hat.
- Why, thank you, David.

167
00:10:54,507 --> 00:10:57,718
See? Uncle Jumba
said it made me look top-heavy.

168
00:10:57,802 --> 00:10:59,845
Aunt Pleakley wanted the truth.

169
00:10:59,929 --> 00:11:04,225
What we want and what we need
are entirely different things.

170
00:11:04,308 --> 00:11:08,896
It's true what they say. Men are from
Mars, and women are from Venus.

171
00:11:08,979 --> 00:11:10,564
- Nani.
- Yeah? Uh-huh?

172
00:11:10,648 --> 00:11:13,275
You've been stressing,
so I got movie tickets.

173
00:11:13,359 --> 00:11:17,363
Movie? David, I would love to, really,

174
00:11:17,446 --> 00:11:19,406
but I'm gonna have to rain check.

175
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:21,825
That's OK. I understand.

176
00:11:21,909 --> 00:11:24,495
Great. Thanks for understanding.

177
00:11:24,578 --> 00:11:27,956
I dare you to say
that's not flattering, even on him.

178
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:31,251
OK, I'm sure that Kumu
isn't interested in this.

179
00:11:31,335 --> 00:11:34,171
<i>- Nice to be meeting you.
- Au revoir. </i>

180
00:11:34,254 --> 00:11:36,256
Bye-bye.

181
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:38,592
Boy. Good thing we were here.

182
00:11:39,843 --> 00:11:41,720
I'm not talking to you.

183
00:11:41,803 --> 00:11:44,932
Ha-ha...
Sorry about the relatives, Kumu.

184
00:11:45,015 --> 00:11:47,059
Yeah, sorry. Thanks for coming.

185
00:11:47,142 --> 00:11:49,728
See ya at the competition.

186
00:11:49,811 --> 00:11:51,647
Lilo?

187
00:11:58,904 --> 00:12:01,323
I know you want to be
in the competition,

188
00:12:01,406 --> 00:12:04,826
but your behavior today
makes me think you're not ready.

189
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:08,330
No. I'm ready. It's just...

190
00:12:09,289 --> 00:12:11,124
Mertle pushed my buttons.

191
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:13,084
I'll be good. I mean it.

192
00:12:13,168 --> 00:12:18,340
I hope so. If there's any more trouble,
you won't be allowed in the competition.

193
00:12:18,423 --> 00:12:21,009
I promise.
There won't be any trouble.

194
00:12:21,092 --> 00:12:25,055
I promise, promise.
I triple promise.

195
00:12:25,138 --> 00:12:28,141
- OK, then.
- Thank you, Kumu.

196
00:12:28,224 --> 00:12:31,353
You don't have to worry.
I've seen the error of my ways.

197
00:12:31,436 --> 00:12:35,231
I will be good from now on
and be the best hula dancer ever.

198
00:12:35,315 --> 00:12:37,233
You'll see. I can do it.

199
00:12:37,317 --> 00:12:40,195
There's no way I can do this.

200
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:48,244
Just because my mom was a great
hula dancer doesn't mean I am.

201
00:12:48,328 --> 00:12:50,747
The only thing
I know I inherited from her

202
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:53,750
is, well, Nani.

203
00:12:55,627 --> 00:12:57,712
Yeuch!

204
00:12:57,795 --> 00:12:59,339
What if Mertle's right

205
00:12:59,422 --> 00:13:03,009
and everything I do
is gonna be stinky?

206
00:13:03,092 --> 00:13:07,555
Maybe I'm just stinky... like cheese.

207
00:13:13,061 --> 00:13:18,608
But my mom was beautiful like an orchid
and graceful like a wave.

208
00:13:24,989 --> 00:13:26,908
I'll never be like her.

209
00:13:54,977 --> 00:13:57,062
You... you think I can do it?

210
00:13:57,146 --> 00:14:00,232
We do together.

211
00:14:03,527 --> 00:14:05,154
Let's win this thing.

212
00:14:05,237 --> 00:14:07,114
- Okey...
- Dokey.

213
00:14:07,198 --> 00:14:09,575
Hula ideas, take one.

214
00:14:09,658 --> 00:14:12,202
Mummies.

215
00:14:12,286 --> 00:14:14,455
Huh?

216
00:14:14,538 --> 00:14:17,416
Amputation.

217
00:14:17,499 --> 00:14:19,335
Vampire bats.

218
00:14:19,418 --> 00:14:21,128
Recycling.

219
00:14:21,211 --> 00:14:22,880
Gossip.

220
00:14:22,963 --> 00:14:24,465
Skydive.

221
00:14:24,548 --> 00:14:26,091
Ouch.

222
00:14:27,426 --> 00:14:30,095
I wonder if Elvis had these problems.

223
00:14:30,179 --> 00:14:31,638
Done.

224
00:14:31,722 --> 00:14:36,810
OK, everyone, family fun night
is ready to begin.

225
00:14:37,895 --> 00:14:39,480
Everyone?

226
00:14:40,731 --> 00:14:42,191
Anyone?

227
00:14:43,775 --> 00:14:46,570
Guys, family fun night.
Everything's ready.

228
00:14:46,653 --> 00:14:48,614
Let's... What's going on?

229
00:14:48,697 --> 00:14:51,909
We're increasing the flow of blood
to our brains to make us think.

230
00:14:51,992 --> 00:14:55,329
- We've only got one day and 23 hours...
- And 16 minutes.

231
00:14:55,412 --> 00:14:57,414
...to come up with the winning idea,

232
00:14:57,497 --> 00:15:00,292
- so please leave us alone to think.
- Please.

233
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:02,961
You'll figure it out, and if you ask me,

234
00:15:03,045 --> 00:15:05,297
it's a perfect time to take a break.

235
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:09,092
- Pass.
- I said, if you ask me, it's...

236
00:15:09,176 --> 00:15:11,094
We kinda didn't ask you.

237
00:15:11,178 --> 00:15:12,888
That's it, you two.

238
00:15:12,971 --> 00:15:16,224
I've been cooking for hours
and finally picked up the house

239
00:15:16,308 --> 00:15:20,270
just so we can have quality
fun time like Mom used to.

240
00:15:20,353 --> 00:15:22,731
You're part of this family,

241
00:15:22,814 --> 00:15:26,902
so you are gonna come downstairs
and have family fun.

242
00:15:26,985 --> 00:15:28,028
Fun, fun, fun!

243
00:15:31,197 --> 00:15:34,909
- Is everyone having fun?
- Oh, yeah!

244
00:15:34,993 --> 00:15:36,828
- Great.
- Loads of fun!

245
00:15:36,911 --> 00:15:39,039
I made sci-fi snacks.

246
00:15:39,122 --> 00:15:40,623
Yummy.

247
00:15:40,707 --> 00:15:43,752
We have deep-fried Martian cockroach.

248
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,255
Mm. Delicious.

249
00:15:47,338 --> 00:15:50,842
- I think I'm gonna throw up.
- Ew. I think someone did.

250
00:15:50,925 --> 00:15:53,887
Uh, Nani, what are these?

251
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:56,764
Alien-eyeball dumplings.

252
00:15:56,848 --> 00:15:59,058
What kinda sick joke is this?

253
00:15:59,142 --> 00:16:01,227
Don't be making her mad. Eat it.

254
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,982
It's good.

255
00:16:13,781 --> 00:16:16,701
- Cockroach?
- I'm too upset to eat.

256
00:16:16,784 --> 00:16:18,786
I'm hula-less.

257
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:21,664
Aw, I'm sure
you'll come up with something.

258
00:16:21,748 --> 00:16:24,083
Come on.
Let's watch the movie.

259
00:16:24,167 --> 00:16:27,920
<i>... are dangerous. They'll destroy
everything in their path. </i>

260
00:16:28,004 --> 00:16:30,006
<i>The authorities are asking all... </i>

261
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:34,010
It's a bit redundant,
don't ya think?

262
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:36,345
Shush.
I'm trying to watch movie.

263
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:37,597
Ew.

264
00:16:44,312 --> 00:16:46,689
- It's so beautiful.
- Nani,

265
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:51,444
I think you did a great job
with family... night.

266
00:16:51,527 --> 00:16:54,030
Psst.
I know what your problem is.

267
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:56,240
- What?
- I'm sorry to break it to you,

268
00:16:56,323 --> 00:16:59,160
but your relationship has fizzled.

269
00:16:59,243 --> 00:17:02,830
- We've been only going out for 3 weeks.
- A fizzle is a fizzle.

270
00:17:02,913 --> 00:17:07,001
According to this,
comfort plus time equals boring.

271
00:17:07,084 --> 00:17:09,295
I think she's just tired.

272
00:17:09,378 --> 00:17:12,590
- Tired, or tired of you?
- Shh.

273
00:17:12,673 --> 00:17:15,259
I wanted to dance
at your wedding, but...

274
00:17:15,342 --> 00:17:18,429
- Shh.
- Fine.

275
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:33,569
Hmm? Hmm.

276
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:35,362
Mm-mm.

277
00:17:37,114 --> 00:17:40,200
Ow! Huh?

278
00:17:49,626 --> 00:17:51,211
What?

279
00:18:02,431 --> 00:18:05,058
- Ah, Stitch!
- Oh, Stitch!

280
00:18:07,686 --> 00:18:08,937
Stitch?

281
00:18:15,152 --> 00:18:16,820
Oh, no.

282
00:18:17,737 --> 00:18:20,031
Jumba, Jumba, slow down!

283
00:18:20,115 --> 00:18:22,284
Where ya going? Include me!

284
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:24,703
- Something's wrong with 626.
- What is it?

285
00:18:24,786 --> 00:18:26,997
- I don't know.
- Or won't tell?

286
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,457
Ow! My good eye!

287
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,293
You don't trust me.

288
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:34,087
Fine. You won't tell me
what's going on.

289
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:35,922
I won't tell you something.

290
00:18:36,006 --> 00:18:40,969
Ooh, what an interesting secret
I have that I won't tell Jumba.

291
00:18:41,052 --> 00:18:43,013
Ooh, my, it's a juicy one.

292
00:18:43,096 --> 00:18:45,640
- Quiet, you.
- OK, I don't have a secret.

293
00:18:45,724 --> 00:18:49,185
But don't shut me out.
Let me in. Let me...

294
00:18:49,269 --> 00:18:52,188
- What's that?
- Is sample of Stitch's fur.

295
00:18:53,982 --> 00:18:56,192
Now we shall see.

296
00:18:58,945 --> 00:19:00,697
No. No.

297
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:03,283
Those idiot police.

298
00:19:03,366 --> 00:19:05,577
I hoped this day would never come.

299
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:09,872
What are you talking about?
What is wrong with Stitch?

300
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:16,254
During his creation,
Stitch was never fully charged.

301
00:19:20,508 --> 00:19:22,969
There is it.

302
00:19:35,815 --> 00:19:38,192
That's not so easy on the throat.

303
00:19:39,652 --> 00:19:43,906
Oh, can it be? Have I done it?

304
00:19:52,081 --> 00:19:55,543
So cute, so fluffy, even.

305
00:19:57,378 --> 00:20:00,047
Where did I go wrong?

306
00:20:02,007 --> 00:20:05,261
Ha-ha-ha! What a relief.

307
00:20:05,344 --> 00:20:09,807
Your name is 626. Isn't that nice?

308
00:20:11,183 --> 00:20:12,935
Oh, I know, I know.

309
00:20:13,018 --> 00:20:15,229
You want to get out
and wreak havoc,

310
00:20:15,312 --> 00:20:18,524
but your molecules
need to be charged.

311
00:20:18,607 --> 00:20:21,026
That's most important part.

312
00:20:27,533 --> 00:20:30,995
Meanwhile, I've got a surprise for you.
Close your eyes.

313
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:34,540
No peeking. He cheats already.

314
00:20:34,623 --> 00:20:36,166
Aw, jiggiebig.

315
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:39,628
Ta-da!

316
00:20:39,712 --> 00:20:41,672
If it's too big, I have it taken in.

317
00:20:41,755 --> 00:20:43,090
Uh-oh.

318
00:20:43,173 --> 00:20:47,386
- Open up! Intergalactic Police!
- Is nobody home.

319
00:20:47,469 --> 00:20:51,515
Uh, cheque is in mail.
I'm in the tub.

320
00:20:53,308 --> 00:20:57,020
You are under arrest
for illegal genetic experimentation.

321
00:20:57,104 --> 00:20:59,565
You idiots, you will ruin everything.

322
00:20:59,648 --> 00:21:02,901
- Oh, no.
- Yeah. Tell it to the Council.

323
00:21:02,985 --> 00:21:05,320
- You two, get the evidence.
- Stop.

324
00:21:05,404 --> 00:21:07,698
His molecules aren't fully charged.

325
00:21:07,781 --> 00:21:09,574
No, no! No! Oh.

326
00:21:09,658 --> 00:21:11,743
<i> Warning. Warning. </i>

327
00:21:11,827 --> 00:21:14,246
<i>Electromagnetic bonding incomplete. </i>

328
00:21:14,329 --> 00:21:17,874
No, no, there's no telling
what will happen.

329
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:19,918
Let me go. No!

330
00:21:20,001 --> 00:21:24,923
What will become
of my little monstrosity?

331
00:21:25,006 --> 00:21:27,926
Now his circuits are going haywire.

332
00:21:28,009 --> 00:21:30,011
That's why he was freaking out.

333
00:21:30,095 --> 00:21:32,305
He can't control it. If it continues,

334
00:21:32,389 --> 00:21:35,684
his circuits will burn
themselves out like supernova.

335
00:21:35,767 --> 00:21:37,978
Can ya...
Can ya fix him?

336
00:21:38,061 --> 00:21:42,065
I must, or my little Stitch
will shut down...

337
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:45,568
...for good.

338
00:21:59,624 --> 00:22:03,086
Stitch? Stitch?

339
00:22:19,852 --> 00:22:22,772
Once there was a boy
with big, puffy hair

340
00:22:22,855 --> 00:22:26,275
who loved meat loaf a lot.

341
00:22:26,359 --> 00:22:29,320
So he put the leftovers
in his pillowcase.

342
00:22:29,404 --> 00:22:32,240
But that night,
a buzzard flew in the window

343
00:22:32,323 --> 00:22:34,909
and tried to eat the meat loaf.

344
00:22:34,992 --> 00:22:37,662
Trashed the whole house.

345
00:22:37,745 --> 00:22:41,124
And do you know
who that boy was?

346
00:22:41,207 --> 00:22:43,251
- Elvis.
- Huh?

347
00:22:43,334 --> 00:22:45,837
True story.

348
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:49,924
I think Stitch feel better.

349
00:22:50,007 --> 00:22:52,552
Even Elvis slipped up sometimes.

350
00:22:52,635 --> 00:22:56,555
But he never stopped trying,
and neither can we.

351
00:22:58,057 --> 00:22:59,600
Elvis!

352
00:23:15,199 --> 00:23:16,826
At ease.

353
00:23:16,909 --> 00:23:20,454
When Elvis was in the army,
he got things done.

354
00:23:20,538 --> 00:23:26,085
Here's a map that shows
every place Elvis went to in Kauai.

355
00:23:26,168 --> 00:23:29,171
Our mission:
Go to these places,

356
00:23:29,255 --> 00:23:33,008
where the King will give us
the idea for our hula.

357
00:23:34,218 --> 00:23:36,512
To the hovercraft.

358
00:23:36,595 --> 00:23:40,974
Huh! Thanks to a certain sister
of mine, we'll have to walk.

359
00:25:15,902 --> 00:25:19,948
<i>This is the exact bench
where Elvis sat in Blue Hawaii. </i>

360
00:25:21,199 --> 00:25:23,576
Oh, yeah. That's him.

361
00:25:24,661 --> 00:25:26,245
I can't believe it.

362
00:25:26,329 --> 00:25:28,331
My butt is in the shadow

363
00:25:28,414 --> 00:25:31,125
of the butt of Elvis Presley.

364
00:25:31,209 --> 00:25:33,211
Oh. Yes.

365
00:25:33,294 --> 00:25:35,213
OK, Elvis.

366
00:25:35,296 --> 00:25:39,384
We're ready to receive
a great idea for our hula.

367
00:25:39,467 --> 00:25:41,427
Hula... hula...

368
00:25:53,064 --> 00:25:55,149
That's it. I got it.

369
00:25:55,233 --> 00:25:59,445
Elvis is trying to tell us
to do a hula about a chicken.

370
00:26:02,448 --> 00:26:05,451
No, he's not.

371
00:26:05,534 --> 00:26:09,288
There's plenty of other places
on the map that we can go to.

372
00:26:10,665 --> 00:26:12,416
We better hurry.

373
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:15,044
Hey, drop it!

374
00:26:17,421 --> 00:26:18,756
Gotcha.

375
00:26:24,845 --> 00:26:26,055
Yes!

376
00:26:26,138 --> 00:26:27,890
Whoa.

377
00:26:37,983 --> 00:26:39,902
No...

378
00:26:40,903 --> 00:26:43,113
We're sunk.

379
00:27:00,464 --> 00:27:03,425
I know it's hard
to keep the faith sometimes,

380
00:27:03,509 --> 00:27:05,594
but if you don't give up on Elvis,

381
00:27:05,677 --> 00:27:07,763
Elvis won't give up on you.

382
00:27:17,314 --> 00:27:20,525
That song. It's about
the Hawaiian goddess Hi'iaka.

383
00:27:20,609 --> 00:27:22,611
Hey! That's right, Lilo.

384
00:27:22,694 --> 00:27:24,237
That's a great story.

385
00:27:24,321 --> 00:27:28,033
Friendship, jealousy,
death by molten lava!

386
00:27:28,116 --> 00:27:30,410
Do you know what this means?

387
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:34,206
Thank you, Elvis!

388
00:27:34,289 --> 00:27:36,374
We got our hula.

389
00:27:46,009 --> 00:27:50,388
Stupid supercomputer.

390
00:27:50,472 --> 00:27:53,725
I know, Mom, but Jumba and I
have been very busy.

391
00:27:53,808 --> 00:27:55,310
My mom says hi.

392
00:27:55,393 --> 00:27:57,228
- Yeah, hi...
- He's waving.

393
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:59,939
I can't talk about it, Mom.
It's top secret.

394
00:28:00,023 --> 00:28:02,776
- I said I was sorry.
- That's it. That's it!

395
00:28:02,859 --> 00:28:05,278
I have to go, Mom. Talk to you Sunday.

396
00:28:05,362 --> 00:28:07,530
I finished plans
for new fusion chamber

397
00:28:07,614 --> 00:28:10,200
- that will recharge Stitch.
- Way to go.

398
00:28:10,283 --> 00:28:13,161
But we don't have alien technology
to build it.

399
00:28:13,244 --> 00:28:14,579
Way to burst a bubble.

400
00:28:14,662 --> 00:28:17,248
We'll have to find
primitive Earth machinery

401
00:28:17,332 --> 00:28:19,667
and just hope it works.

402
00:28:19,751 --> 00:28:23,213
No prob. I can get
all those parts from the house.

403
00:28:23,296 --> 00:28:25,506
Agh!

404
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:27,759
Stitch is having another episode.

405
00:28:27,842 --> 00:28:29,761
They're getting worse.

406
00:28:29,844 --> 00:28:33,264
Hurry. These parts
are crucial to saving Stitch's life.

407
00:28:33,348 --> 00:28:35,391
Nothing can go wrong.

408
00:28:45,193 --> 00:28:46,778
Target sighted.

409
00:28:47,361 --> 00:28:49,238
Gotcha.

410
00:28:49,322 --> 00:28:52,200
Oh, no, it's you. I mean, hi, Nani.

411
00:28:52,283 --> 00:28:54,660
What are you doing with the toaster?

412
00:28:54,744 --> 00:28:57,747
This?
Yeah, interesting question.

413
00:28:57,830 --> 00:29:00,499
- What's going on?
- I was just about to...

414
00:29:00,583 --> 00:29:02,710
We have to hurry to... Nani...

415
00:29:02,793 --> 00:29:04,587
- To make toast.
- Toast?

416
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:07,048
Making toast.
We're making toast.

417
00:29:07,131 --> 00:29:10,301
Toast. Who doesn't enjoy
nice crispy piece of toast?

418
00:29:10,384 --> 00:29:11,927
Answer: Nobody.

419
00:29:12,011 --> 00:29:14,513
And there's so many different kinds.

420
00:29:14,597 --> 00:29:18,434
- Rye, sourdough, pumpernickel.
- You can put marmalade on it.

421
00:29:18,517 --> 00:29:21,645
Tasty toast.
You don't know what you're missing.

422
00:29:21,729 --> 00:29:23,647
- Care to try some?
- That's OK.

423
00:29:23,731 --> 00:29:25,483
I've gotta go to work.

424
00:29:25,566 --> 00:29:27,276
- Oh, and, boys?
- Hmm?

425
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:30,362
Don't play with the toaster.

426
00:29:31,697 --> 00:29:33,365
Hi, David. Gotta run.

427
00:29:33,449 --> 00:29:36,368
If you're hungry,
we've got toast. Lots of toast.

428
00:29:36,452 --> 00:29:38,954
- Should I make more?
- Just get rid of him.

429
00:29:39,038 --> 00:29:41,498
- But how?
- You're the Earth expert.

430
00:29:43,375 --> 00:29:46,629
Hmm...

431
00:29:46,712 --> 00:29:50,132
David, David, David.

432
00:29:50,215 --> 00:29:55,012
Poor, sweet David.
Trusting, naive David.

433
00:29:55,095 --> 00:29:59,558
- OK, maybe I do need help.
- You're in good hands.

434
00:29:59,641 --> 00:30:02,519
For 29.95, you can have
the kayak all day long.

435
00:30:02,603 --> 00:30:04,104
But, of course...

436
00:30:04,188 --> 00:30:07,065
Look at her. Tsk. Tsk.

437
00:30:07,149 --> 00:30:09,610
Doesn't even know you're here.

438
00:30:09,693 --> 00:30:12,446
- Maybe because we're hiding.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

439
00:30:12,529 --> 00:30:14,948
Is my relationship dying? No.

440
00:30:15,032 --> 00:30:17,451
OK, OK.
What you think I should do?

441
00:30:17,534 --> 00:30:20,537
Well, it's obvious
she's taking you for granted.

442
00:30:20,621 --> 00:30:24,750
But she won't if she sees
another woman interested.

443
00:30:24,833 --> 00:30:27,669
- What other woman?
- Whoo-hoo!

444
00:30:27,753 --> 00:30:29,838
- Yeah!
- Have fun.

445
00:30:29,921 --> 00:30:34,801
Oh, my,
you're so fascinating and tan.

446
00:30:34,885 --> 00:30:38,013
Whoa! I'm so clumsy.

447
00:30:38,096 --> 00:30:39,890
You've gotta be kidding me.

448
00:30:39,973 --> 00:30:42,184
- I don't think...
- It's working.

449
00:30:42,267 --> 00:30:44,519
- She's coming over.
- Hey, Nani.

450
00:30:44,603 --> 00:30:47,063
No waving. Be cool. Wow!

451
00:30:47,147 --> 00:30:49,608
Is that a deltoid or a rhomboid?

452
00:30:51,443 --> 00:30:53,945
OK. Hey, David, I'm off at five.

453
00:30:54,029 --> 00:30:55,739
- Wanna get some dinner?
- Great.

454
00:30:55,822 --> 00:30:57,782
- He has plans.
- He does?

455
00:30:57,866 --> 00:31:00,327
With me.
I'm the new girl on the island.

456
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:02,412
Let me get this straight.

457
00:31:02,495 --> 00:31:05,206
You came here
and interrupted me to tell me

458
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:08,585
you have pretend plans with Pleakley?

459
00:31:08,668 --> 00:31:11,421
I, uh, don't know
what you're talking about.

460
00:31:11,504 --> 00:31:15,049
My name is Inga.
I'm a foreign exchange student.

461
00:31:15,133 --> 00:31:16,718
Are you jealous?

462
00:31:16,801 --> 00:31:19,679
Mmm... No.

463
00:31:21,181 --> 00:31:22,724
Well, you blew it.

464
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,226
Aha!

465
00:31:43,119 --> 00:31:46,205
<i> This is how
the story goes, Stitch. </i>

466
00:31:46,289 --> 00:31:50,043
<i>Once, there was a beautiful
goddess named Hi'iaka</i>

467
00:31:50,126 --> 00:31:53,004
<i>and a handsome mortal
named Lo'hiau. </i>

468
00:31:54,589 --> 00:31:58,009
<i>They were as close
as two people could be. </i>

469
00:31:59,719 --> 00:32:01,554
Oops!

470
00:32:01,637 --> 00:32:03,764
<i>But one day, Pelé,</i>

471
00:32:03,848 --> 00:32:07,727
<i>the volcano goddess,
grew jealous of their friendship. </i>

472
00:32:10,104 --> 00:32:14,900
<i>So she took Lo'hiau
and threw him into a volcano</i>

473
00:32:14,984 --> 00:32:17,028
<i>filled with molten lava. </i>

474
00:32:17,111 --> 00:32:20,197
- Waagh!
- Oh... Stitch!

475
00:32:20,281 --> 00:32:21,741
My bad.

476
00:32:27,246 --> 00:32:30,249
<i>Hi'iaka discovered
his body in a cavern</i>

477
00:32:30,332 --> 00:32:33,961
<i>by a sea cliff,
and she stayed with him,</i>

478
00:32:34,044 --> 00:32:37,673
<i>praying to the gods
to bring Lo'hiau's spirit back. </i>

479
00:32:40,301 --> 00:32:44,263
<i>And it worked. 
Her love brought him back to life,</i>

480
00:32:44,346 --> 00:32:49,476
<i>proving that love
is more powerful than death. </i>

481
00:32:58,777 --> 00:33:00,904
We are ready for rehearsal.

482
00:33:04,742 --> 00:33:07,745
OK, girls,
this is your last rehearsal

483
00:33:07,828 --> 00:33:09,788
before tomorrow's competition.

484
00:33:09,872 --> 00:33:13,000
What if I forget the moves
and Mertle laughs at me?

485
00:33:13,083 --> 00:33:16,253
And I get mad and pound her?

486
00:33:16,336 --> 00:33:18,839
You gotta help me, Stitch.
I need you.

487
00:33:18,922 --> 00:33:20,757
We do together.

488
00:33:25,262 --> 00:33:28,557
Our hula is about an ancient friendship

489
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:32,227
that proves love
is more powerful than death.

490
00:33:32,311 --> 00:33:34,062
Oh, brother.

491
00:33:34,146 --> 00:33:37,941
The great goddess Hi'iaka...
That's me!

492
00:33:38,025 --> 00:33:41,236
And the brave and handsome
mortal Lo'hiau.

493
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:45,782
That's Stitch.

494
00:33:50,912 --> 00:33:55,333
I said,
the handsome mortal Lo'hiau!

495
00:33:57,752 --> 00:34:01,089
Oh, handsome mortal!

496
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:03,091
Stink-o-rama.

497
00:34:03,174 --> 00:34:05,135
Stitch, get out here.

498
00:34:08,013 --> 00:34:10,348
What are you doing?

499
00:34:11,641 --> 00:34:13,476
Cut it out.

500
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:16,813
That's not what we practiced.

501
00:34:16,896 --> 00:34:18,189
Stitch!

502
00:34:20,316 --> 00:34:23,153
No!

503
00:34:23,236 --> 00:34:26,239
- Stop it!
- He's crazy!

504
00:34:29,242 --> 00:34:30,910
Girls, girls, get behind me.

505
00:34:30,994 --> 00:34:33,955
Lilo, get control of your dog.
Nice doggy...

506
00:34:34,038 --> 00:34:35,957
Lilo! Lilo!

507
00:34:44,632 --> 00:34:49,512
Lilo, you will not be allowed
to rehearse at this hulau again.

508
00:34:53,975 --> 00:34:56,936
Lilo, I... I...

509
00:35:02,733 --> 00:35:06,445
Come on.
It couldn't have been that bad.

510
00:35:06,529 --> 00:35:10,032
<i>- It was.
- Mahalo.  Have a good one.</i>

511
00:35:10,116 --> 00:35:14,328
- You're not listening to me.
- I'm listening. I have to work.

512
00:35:14,412 --> 00:35:17,290
My hula career is falling to pieces,

513
00:35:17,373 --> 00:35:19,834
and you're worried about stinking work?

514
00:35:19,917 --> 00:35:22,461
Stitch needs you
to be patient with him.

515
00:35:22,545 --> 00:35:25,423
- He did it on purpose.
- You don't mean that.

516
00:35:25,506 --> 00:35:28,009
You should have seen
the way he was acting.

517
00:35:28,092 --> 00:35:31,929
- Aren't you being overdramatic?
- His goodness level is at rock bottom.

518
00:37:16,992 --> 00:37:18,618
Oh, yeah.

519
00:37:20,245 --> 00:37:22,330
The great goddess Hi'iaka...
That's me.

520
00:37:22,372 --> 00:37:24,457
The great goddess Hi'iaka...
That's me.

521
00:37:24,541 --> 00:37:28,461
...and the brave mortal Lo'hiau...

522
00:37:28,545 --> 00:37:31,214
Whoa. That's also me.

523
00:37:32,132 --> 00:37:33,758
Whoa.

524
00:37:35,301 --> 00:37:37,303
...were best friends.

525
00:37:37,387 --> 00:37:39,639
Lilo, look.

526
00:37:39,722 --> 00:37:43,685
- Their friendship proved...
- I'm good now. No more badness.

527
00:37:43,768 --> 00:37:46,229
Oh, sorry.

528
00:37:47,897 --> 00:37:50,692
- The great goddess Hi'iaka...
- Stitch good.

529
00:37:50,775 --> 00:37:52,986
Stitch, just get outta here.

530
00:37:53,069 --> 00:37:55,780
Fuzzball.

531
00:37:55,863 --> 00:37:58,574
- No, you out.
- No, you.

532
00:37:58,658 --> 00:38:00,868
- You. You!
- You. You!

533
00:38:00,952 --> 00:38:02,537
Fine.

534
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:04,622
I will.

535
00:38:04,705 --> 00:38:07,208
- No, Stitch will.
- I'm leaving first.

536
00:38:07,291 --> 00:38:10,378
- I'm leaving first! I am.
- No! Stitch first!

537
00:38:10,461 --> 00:38:14,048
Who took my hair...
Who took my hair dryer?

538
00:38:14,131 --> 00:38:16,801
Get back here. You'll be sorry.

539
00:38:16,884 --> 00:38:20,721
- Open this door, trog.
- Who's there?

540
00:38:20,805 --> 00:38:24,058
- Stitch. Open the door.
- OK.

541
00:38:24,141 --> 00:38:26,644
- What is up with you two?
- Nani, it's me.

542
00:38:26,727 --> 00:38:28,980
Neither of you move.

543
00:38:29,063 --> 00:38:33,484
Oh, David,
I'm glad you're here... David?

544
00:38:33,567 --> 00:38:36,404
Nani, you're not
the only fish in the sea.

545
00:38:36,487 --> 00:38:40,950
- Tell her you have...
- Because I have a lot of... uh...

546
00:38:41,033 --> 00:38:44,829
- Tell her your options.
- Options?

547
00:38:44,912 --> 00:38:47,414
Options. Oh, really?

548
00:38:47,498 --> 00:38:49,083
<i>Olé!</i>

549
00:38:56,382 --> 00:38:58,926
Are you jealous?

550
00:38:59,009 --> 00:39:00,886
Ai-ya.

551
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:03,681
- She's touching me.
- I'm not touching you.

552
00:39:03,764 --> 00:39:06,183
- Agh! You're touching me!
- Not touching.

553
00:39:06,266 --> 00:39:08,978
- Touching me!
- It's free air.

554
00:39:09,061 --> 00:39:11,897
- Ew!
- Would you cut it out?

555
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:14,358
This is crazy.
You guys are family.

556
00:39:14,441 --> 00:39:17,277
<i>Ohana...  Ow!</i>

557
00:39:17,361 --> 00:39:21,406
- Why are you fighting?
- Because he ruins everything.

558
00:39:21,490 --> 00:39:25,077
- Not my fault.
- Then whose fault is it?

559
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:27,621
- You're dead meat.
- Whoa!

560
00:39:27,704 --> 00:39:29,873
That... is... it!

561
00:39:29,957 --> 00:39:33,252
Go to your room and make up
like loving friends!

562
00:39:33,335 --> 00:39:35,003
- You're gross.
- Stupid head.

563
00:39:35,087 --> 00:39:36,922
Keep walking.

564
00:39:45,263 --> 00:39:49,643
- Stitch sorry.
- We said we were gonna be good.

565
00:39:49,726 --> 00:39:51,311
I needed you, Stitch.

566
00:39:57,275 --> 00:39:59,903
Stitch good again.

567
00:40:04,783 --> 00:40:06,743
If you promise to be good,

568
00:40:06,826 --> 00:40:09,287
I'll give you one more chance.

569
00:40:09,371 --> 00:40:13,583
- But I want you to promise.
- Oh, yeah.

570
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:19,422
You get the costumes,
and I'll get the record player.

571
00:40:21,925 --> 00:40:25,261
Stitch good.
Good, good, good, good, good.

572
00:40:25,345 --> 00:40:26,971
Stitch good...

573
00:40:35,772 --> 00:40:37,357
We are ready.

574
00:40:40,485 --> 00:40:42,153
- Stitch.
- Lilo.

575
00:40:42,237 --> 00:40:45,198
- Everything's ruined.
- I... I sorry.

576
00:40:45,281 --> 00:40:47,784
I don't know
why I ever believed you.

577
00:40:47,867 --> 00:40:50,370
Something wrong with Stitch.

578
00:40:50,453 --> 00:40:52,538
I know what's wrong with you.

579
00:40:52,622 --> 00:40:56,793
You're bad, and you'll always be bad.

580
00:41:03,966 --> 00:41:06,010
Three. Two. One.

581
00:41:06,094 --> 00:41:07,428
Ta-da!

582
00:41:07,512 --> 00:41:09,097
There it is, Pleakley.

583
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:13,226
The fusion chamber,
the only thing that can save Stitch.

584
00:41:13,309 --> 00:41:16,646
- It's amazing.
- Just another work of genius.

585
00:41:16,729 --> 00:41:19,649
Oh, oh, can I switch it on?
Please, please?

586
00:41:19,732 --> 00:41:21,734
Oh, no, no, no. No, no, no.

587
00:41:21,817 --> 00:41:24,612
That is extremely delicate machine.

588
00:41:24,695 --> 00:41:27,323
It takes superior mind.

589
00:41:33,663 --> 00:41:36,791
Heh, thanks to me, crisis is over.

590
00:41:36,874 --> 00:41:38,709
Oh!

591
00:41:40,711 --> 00:41:42,963
Jumba? Jumba?

592
00:41:43,047 --> 00:41:45,132
What happened?

593
00:41:55,518 --> 00:41:58,729
That's it, Pleakley. It's over.

594
00:41:58,812 --> 00:42:01,649
I can't build a new fusion chamber.

595
00:42:01,732 --> 00:42:04,360
Sure you can,
like you built the first one.

596
00:42:04,443 --> 00:42:10,074
I didn't build first one.
I ordered it... from catalogue.

597
00:42:10,157 --> 00:42:11,617
A catalogue?

598
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:15,537
And now there is no hope
for my little creation.

599
00:42:22,878 --> 00:42:25,923
Jumba has failed family.

600
00:42:26,006 --> 00:42:30,052
So you didn't build
the first fusion chamber. So what?

601
00:42:30,135 --> 00:42:34,056
You still built Stitch, didn't ya?
Well, didn't ya?

602
00:42:34,139 --> 00:42:35,599
Yes.

603
00:42:35,682 --> 00:42:38,310
And you're still an evil genius.
Admit it.

604
00:42:38,393 --> 00:42:41,730
No, I... I don't like to brag.

605
00:42:41,813 --> 00:42:46,276
Well, see, that's why
you're the only one who can do it.

606
00:42:52,866 --> 00:42:54,618
Pleakley, my wrench!

607
00:42:59,915 --> 00:43:01,625
Lilo?

608
00:43:05,212 --> 00:43:06,797
Hey, Lilo.

609
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:10,175
I'm not doing the hula with him.
So don't try to make me.

610
00:43:10,258 --> 00:43:11,885
OK, OK.

611
00:43:11,968 --> 00:43:14,429
He's ruining my chance of winning.

612
00:43:14,513 --> 00:43:17,557
Lilo, baby, it's just a contest.

613
00:43:17,641 --> 00:43:19,768
No, it's not. Now get off my bed.

614
00:43:19,851 --> 00:43:22,979
- Not until we talk about this.
- You're no help!

615
00:43:23,063 --> 00:43:26,107
- I wish Mom were here.
- I'm doing the best I can.

616
00:43:26,191 --> 00:43:30,278
- Well, it's not good enough.
- Don't you think I know that?

617
00:43:37,118 --> 00:43:39,496
Oh...

618
00:43:49,672 --> 00:43:52,175
Hey.
Remember how she would always

619
00:43:52,258 --> 00:43:54,594
make up those funny constellations?

620
00:43:54,677 --> 00:43:56,638
Like Swiss Cheese Man?

621
00:43:56,721 --> 00:43:59,557
Where is the Stinky Bag
of Garbage again?

622
00:43:59,641 --> 00:44:02,393
Near the Sour Milky Way.

623
00:44:02,477 --> 00:44:04,479
Right near the Old Lady...

624
00:44:04,562 --> 00:44:07,648
...with the
Chihuahua on her Head.

625
00:44:12,653 --> 00:44:16,824
I have to win the contest,
just like Mom did.

626
00:44:16,908 --> 00:44:22,788
If I win, she'll know I'm good,
and she'll be proud of me.

627
00:44:23,831 --> 00:44:25,458
Oh, baby.

628
00:44:25,541 --> 00:44:30,129
You don't have to win anything
for Mom to be proud of you.

629
00:44:30,213 --> 00:44:34,091
- How do you know?
- Because I know everything.

630
00:44:35,176 --> 00:44:37,386
OK, I don't know everything,

631
00:44:37,470 --> 00:44:42,808
but I think Mom would be proud of you
just for being you.

632
00:44:43,809 --> 00:44:45,811
You too.

633
00:44:47,313 --> 00:44:49,315
Thanks, Lilo.

634
00:45:47,122 --> 00:45:49,041
Stitch good.

635
00:45:54,713 --> 00:45:56,673
Stitch good now.

636
00:46:46,431 --> 00:46:48,183
Do you think Lilo will show up?

637
00:46:48,266 --> 00:46:52,437
After that rehearsal?
She wouldn't dare.

638
00:47:46,032 --> 00:47:49,618
I just wanted to say
I am very proud of all your hard work.

639
00:47:49,702 --> 00:47:52,997
If it were up to me,
you would all win first place.

640
00:47:55,082 --> 00:47:58,127
He's just saying that
so the losers don't feel bad.

641
00:47:58,210 --> 00:48:01,255
Hi, Nani.

642
00:48:01,338 --> 00:48:03,340
Uh, yeah.

643
00:48:04,467 --> 00:48:06,218
OK.

644
00:48:08,762 --> 00:48:12,057
Welcome to
our annual May Day Festival,

645
00:48:12,141 --> 00:48:15,769
<i>where one of our little girls
will be chosen alaka'i. </i>

646
00:48:15,853 --> 00:48:19,898
First up is Aleka,
doing the dance of the pineapple.

647
00:48:27,239 --> 00:48:29,700
Ah, that should do it.

648
00:48:35,205 --> 00:48:38,208
What if it doesn't work?

649
00:48:38,292 --> 00:48:40,043
It will.

650
00:48:51,013 --> 00:48:53,265
<i>Ooh, mai ka i, Aleka.</i>

651
00:48:53,348 --> 00:48:55,851
Next up is Mertle Edmunds.

652
00:48:59,521 --> 00:49:03,817
It's a gift certificate
to my daddy's store. Hit it.

653
00:49:06,403 --> 00:49:09,906
Legend tells of a man named Karl

654
00:49:09,990 --> 00:49:13,326
who dreamt of offering
authentic Hawaiian collectibles

655
00:49:13,410 --> 00:49:15,871
at an affordable price.

656
00:49:15,954 --> 00:49:20,208
Like this costume
in seven natural colors,

657
00:49:20,292 --> 00:49:25,714
and these genuine faux pearls,
each a jewel of the Pacific.

658
00:49:26,882 --> 00:49:28,842
The best things in life

659
00:49:28,925 --> 00:49:33,346
are marked down for clearance
this weekend at Karl's.

660
00:49:34,598 --> 00:49:36,808
Mertle, what can I say?

661
00:49:36,891 --> 00:49:38,977
Thank you.

662
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:42,814
It's in the bag.

663
00:49:42,897 --> 00:49:46,776
If Jumba and Pleakley don't get here
soon, they're gonna miss Lilo.

664
00:49:51,990 --> 00:49:54,409
- No.
- What's happening?

665
00:49:54,492 --> 00:49:59,414
His circuits are about to blow. We have
to get him in the fusion chamber now!

666
00:49:59,497 --> 00:50:02,458
- Shouldn't we test it?
- There isn't time.

667
00:50:03,918 --> 00:50:05,712
Next we have Lilo,

668
00:50:05,795 --> 00:50:09,257
who's doing her hula
about an ancient friendship.

669
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:11,926
This is it.

670
00:50:12,010 --> 00:50:14,345
- You'll be great.
- Stitch?

671
00:50:14,429 --> 00:50:18,850
- I just want to say I...
- I can't talk now.

672
00:50:18,933 --> 00:50:22,311
- I have to go on.
- I know, I...

673
00:50:22,395 --> 00:50:25,022
- Oh, no, badness coming on.
- What?

674
00:50:25,106 --> 00:50:28,192
- I... I have to...
- Are you OK?

675
00:50:29,277 --> 00:50:30,653
Stitch!

676
00:50:40,371 --> 00:50:42,206
No.

677
00:50:42,290 --> 00:50:46,210
- Stitch?
- No, Lilo. Too dangerous.

678
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,797
- Stitch?
- Lilo, it's your turn.

679
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,299
Everybody's waiting.

680
00:51:01,684 --> 00:51:05,312
My hula is about
an ancient friendship...

681
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:08,274
...that proves love

682
00:51:08,357 --> 00:51:10,776
is more powerful than death.

683
00:51:42,224 --> 00:51:44,351
I'm sorry, Mom.

684
00:51:48,897 --> 00:51:51,483
Stitch! Come back!

685
00:51:51,567 --> 00:51:54,778
- Have you seen Stitch?
- We thought he was with you.

686
00:51:54,862 --> 00:51:59,157
- Lilo, baby, what happened?
- Something's wrong with Stitch.

687
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:01,326
He's malfunctioning.

688
00:52:01,410 --> 00:52:03,495
And if we don't find him soon...

689
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:12,921
- Stitch!
- Stitch?

690
00:52:13,004 --> 00:52:15,674
- Oh, Stitch! Where are you?
- Stitch.

691
00:52:15,757 --> 00:52:17,426
You there, brudda, brudda?

692
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:19,761
Stitch!

693
00:52:30,772 --> 00:52:32,482
No!

694
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:35,026
Hey, we'll find him.

695
00:52:37,112 --> 00:52:40,949
- We looked everywhere.
- He only has few minutes left.

696
00:52:43,159 --> 00:52:45,120
- The ship.
- The fusion chamber.

697
00:52:45,203 --> 00:52:46,913
Stitch!

698
00:53:03,346 --> 00:53:04,806
Stitch.

699
00:53:10,436 --> 00:53:12,605
We have to stop him.

700
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:13,856
Whoo!

701
00:53:17,777 --> 00:53:21,239
- I think I should drive.
- Two eyes. My car. I'm driving.

702
00:53:23,074 --> 00:53:27,203
At the rate he is going, he's soon
to be accelerating into stratosphere.

703
00:53:27,286 --> 00:53:29,664
If only we had way
to communicate with him.

704
00:53:29,747 --> 00:53:34,544
Stitch has taken off in the ship,
and we have no way to contact him.

705
00:53:34,627 --> 00:53:37,547
- Poor Jumba. He's worked so hard.
- Give me that!

706
00:53:37,630 --> 00:53:41,551
Yes, yes... Yes, Mother Pleakley.
He'll call you back.

707
00:53:41,634 --> 00:53:45,179
<i>Hello. Thanks for using
the Uninhabited Planet Index,</i>

708
00:53:45,263 --> 00:53:49,016
<i>your guide to the galaxy's
most isolated and lonely locations. </i>

709
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:52,937
<i>If your selection is Planet Z-13,
engage hyper-drive. </i>

710
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:56,232
<i> Stitch!
Can you hear me? I need you. </i>

711
00:53:56,315 --> 00:53:58,234
Please come back.

712
00:53:58,317 --> 00:54:02,363
Stitch can never come back.

713
00:54:08,786 --> 00:54:11,622
- He's lost control of ship.
- What?

714
00:54:20,589 --> 00:54:22,841
What do we do now?

715
00:54:26,095 --> 00:54:28,389
It was my best hiding place.

716
00:54:34,770 --> 00:54:37,940
Get him into fusion chamber
before his energy runs out.

717
00:54:38,023 --> 00:54:40,567
Is only chance!

718
00:54:54,081 --> 00:54:55,207
No.

719
00:54:57,626 --> 00:54:59,878
Stitch?

720
00:55:08,428 --> 00:55:09,596
Stitch!

721
00:55:12,975 --> 00:55:15,811
No, Lilo. Too dangerous.

722
00:55:15,894 --> 00:55:19,815
You're not dangerous.

723
00:55:19,898 --> 00:55:22,734
We have to get you
into Jumba's machine.

724
00:55:36,206 --> 00:55:39,960
No worry.
I've got you, Nani.

725
00:56:02,941 --> 00:56:05,443
Stitch,
you're gonna be OK now.

726
00:56:07,695 --> 00:56:09,322
Please be OK.

727
00:56:15,036 --> 00:56:17,163
Stitch sorry.

728
00:56:23,836 --> 00:56:25,964
Stitch?

729
00:56:28,716 --> 00:56:31,844
Hurry, before... Oh, no!

730
00:56:31,928 --> 00:56:35,723
Jumba. Jumba, it's not working.

731
00:56:35,807 --> 00:56:37,934
Oh, no.

732
00:56:43,773 --> 00:56:45,608
We're too late.

733
00:57:07,088 --> 00:57:09,465
- No!
- Lilo, wait.

734
00:57:09,548 --> 00:57:12,134
There's nothing you can do.

735
00:57:13,594 --> 00:57:15,179
He's gone.

736
00:57:15,262 --> 00:57:16,680
Oh, honey, come here.

737
00:57:16,764 --> 00:57:18,265
No!

738
00:57:21,644 --> 00:57:23,938
Stitch.

739
00:57:24,021 --> 00:57:26,524
I'm so sorry.

740
00:57:31,028 --> 00:57:33,405
I kept saying how I needed you.

741
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:38,452
But you needed me more.

742
00:57:54,676 --> 00:57:56,678
<i>You're my ohana, Stitch.</i>

743
00:58:00,182 --> 00:58:02,768
And I'll always love you.

744
00:58:49,773 --> 00:58:53,526
Stitch not bad.

745
00:58:53,610 --> 00:58:55,070
Stitch fluffy.

746
00:58:55,153 --> 00:58:56,279
Stitch!

747
00:59:02,869 --> 00:59:04,996
But how is it possible?

748
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:07,082
It's not.

749
00:59:08,208 --> 00:59:11,961
Stitch OK now?

750
00:59:12,962 --> 00:59:14,964
No more nightmares.

751
00:59:16,382 --> 00:59:18,885
Stitch!

752
00:59:18,968 --> 00:59:20,887
You look fluffier than ever.

753
00:59:20,970 --> 00:59:23,264
Come here, you. Group hug!

754
00:59:31,898 --> 00:59:35,234
So Hi'iaka and Lo'hiau
were reunited

755
00:59:35,318 --> 00:59:37,570
and are together to this day.

756
00:59:38,696 --> 00:59:40,573
<i>Kui ka laima!</i>

757
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:43,451
<i>Hoo kee ma!</i>

758
01:00:13,522 --> 01:00:14,690
Nani!

759
01:00:40,382 --> 01:00:43,802
Mom would be so proud of you.
