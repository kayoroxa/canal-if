You get all the news you Need,
All Day Long.

4
00:00:15,979 --> 00:00:16,979
Good morning.

5
00:00:17,147 --> 00:00:20,274
It's 42 degrees at 10:30 on
this Thursday, October 15th.

6
00:00:20,442 --> 00:00:22,776
I'm Stan I. Brooks,
& here's what's happening.

7
00:00:22,944 --> 00:00:25,154
It's day 18
of the garbage strike,

8
00:00:25,321 --> 00:00:27,948
with 10,000 tons of garbage
piling up every day.

9
00:00:28,116 --> 00:00:30,075
Even the nicest sections
of the city

10
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,493
are looking like slums.

11
00:00:31,661 --> 00:00:33,370
Health Commissioner
Edward O'Rourke is

12
00:00:33,455 --> 00:00:35,164
declaring a city-wide
state of emergency

13
00:00:35,331 --> 00:00:36,957
for the first time in decades.

14
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:39,245
There's no need to
wait until somebody dies

15
00:00:39,377 --> 00:00:40,961
or comes down with typhoid fever.

16
00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:43,130
It's already
a serious situation.

17
00:00:43,298 --> 00:00:44,400
It's something that affects

18
00:00:44,424 --> 00:00:45,544
almost everyone in the city,

19
00:00:45,675 --> 00:00:47,718
no matter who they are
or where they live.

20
00:00:47,886 --> 00:00:50,095
You can't go down
no one avenue

21
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:52,181
without seeing nothing
but garbage and rats.

22
00:00:52,348 --> 00:00:53,576
It's starting to
affect my business

23
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,869
when customers can't get in here

24
00:00:54,893 --> 00:00:56,685
because of
the garbage situation.

25
00:00:56,853 --> 00:00:58,581
I'm not out that long
to smell it,

26
00:00:58,605 --> 00:01:00,439
but I think to look at it,
it's terrible.

27
00:01:00,607 --> 00:01:02,065
It don't affect me except

28
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:03,776
for the very bad smell here.

29
00:01:03,943 --> 00:01:04,943
It's horrific.

30
00:01:05,111 --> 00:01:06,320
It's a mess.

31
00:01:06,404 --> 00:01:07,798
I've been in this country
for 50 years,

32
00:01:07,822 --> 00:01:09,262
and I've never seen
anything like it.

33
00:01:09,407 --> 00:01:10,866
What is this world coming to?

34
00:01:11,034 --> 00:01:12,117
Put 'em in a room,

35
00:01:12,202 --> 00:01:13,763
let 'em sit there and talk
until they get it over with.

36
00:01:13,787 --> 00:01:15,996
24 hours, 48 hours,
how long it takes.

37
00:01:16,456 --> 00:01:18,457
The idea of
the National Guard moving in

38
00:01:18,541 --> 00:01:20,000
and cleaning up is a good idea.

39
00:01:20,168 --> 00:01:21,288
In other news,

41
00:01:23,004 --> 00:01:24,505
expressed concern
over the latest

42
00:01:24,589 --> 00:01:26,381
increase in heating oil prices.

43
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:27,758
Renters in the metro area

44
00:01:27,842 --> 00:01:29,259
are certain to feel the pinch...

45
00:02:04,754 --> 00:02:05,940
Yo, what's up
with your shoes, bro?

46
00:02:05,964 --> 00:02:06,964
Nice outfit, pal.

47
00:02:07,131 --> 00:02:08,400
If you're gonna be
a clown, at least you could be

48
00:02:08,424 --> 00:02:10,050
a good one.
You know that, right?

49
00:02:10,969 --> 00:02:12,363
- Hey! Hey!
- Grab it!

50
00:02:12,387 --> 00:02:13,387
Go, go, go!

51
00:02:13,555 --> 00:02:14,721
Hey!

52
00:02:15,098 --> 00:02:16,098
He's coming!

53
00:02:16,266 --> 00:02:18,767
Come on, clown, let's go!
We've got the sign.

54
00:02:18,935 --> 00:02:20,496
- Look at him running.
- Let's go!

55
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,520
Stop them!

56
00:02:21,604 --> 00:02:23,541
Go, go, go, go!
Watch the car, watch the car!

57
00:02:25,942 --> 00:02:27,262
Where's your sign,
clown?

58
00:02:27,861 --> 00:02:29,278
Hey!

59
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,117
Go, clown! Come on!

60
00:02:35,285 --> 00:02:36,368
Stop them!

61
00:02:38,288 --> 00:02:39,663
Go! Come on!

62
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:43,333
Stop them!

63
00:02:43,501 --> 00:02:45,127
Come on, run!

64
00:02:47,255 --> 00:02:48,630
Hey!

65
00:02:49,883 --> 00:02:51,383
You fucking...

66
00:02:56,014 --> 00:02:57,973
Oh, shit! Good hit.

67
00:02:58,141 --> 00:02:59,892
Come on!
Beat his ass up.

68
00:03:00,059 --> 00:03:01,859
Come on! This guy's weak.
He can't do nothing.

69
00:03:01,978 --> 00:03:03,896
Harder! Harder!

70
00:03:04,063 --> 00:03:05,314
Beat him up. Take his stuff.

71
00:03:05,481 --> 00:03:07,733
Let's go, let's go!
Come on. Let's go!

Ha!

74
00:04:51,921 --> 00:04:53,296
Is it just me,

75
00:04:54,465 --> 00:04:56,967
or is it getting crazier
out there?

76
00:05:00,555 --> 00:05:03,390
- It is certainly tense.
- Hmm.

77
00:05:03,933 --> 00:05:05,767
People are upset.

78
00:05:05,935 --> 00:05:08,812
They're struggling.
Looking for work.

79
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:10,355
These are tough times.

80
00:05:13,276 --> 00:05:14,776
How about you?

81
00:05:16,404 --> 00:05:18,488
Have you been keeping up
with your journal?

82
00:05:20,283 --> 00:05:22,034
Yes, ma'am.

83
00:05:23,578 --> 00:05:24,953
Great.

84
00:05:25,872 --> 00:05:27,414
Did you bring it with you?

85
00:05:32,003 --> 00:05:33,086
Arthur.

86
00:05:33,254 --> 00:05:35,589
Last time, I asked you
to bring your journal

87
00:05:35,673 --> 00:05:37,340
with you for these appointments.

88
00:05:38,051 --> 00:05:39,384
Can I see it?

89
00:05:51,355 --> 00:05:54,232
I've been using it as a journal,

90
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:57,778
but also as a joke diary.

91
00:05:58,905 --> 00:06:02,282
Funny thoughts or observations.

92
00:06:03,409 --> 00:06:04,576
I think I told you

93
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:07,829
I'm pursuing a career
in stand-up comedy.

94
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,876
No, you didn't.

95
00:06:14,337 --> 00:06:16,338
I think I did.

96
00:06:24,889 --> 00:06:28,809
"I just hope my death makes
more sense than my life."

97
00:06:44,826 --> 00:06:47,160
How does it feel to
have to come here?

98
00:06:47,578 --> 00:06:50,330
Does it help to
have someone to talk to?

99
00:06:54,377 --> 00:06:55,627
I think I felt better

100
00:06:55,711 --> 00:06:57,712
when I was locked up
in the hospital.

101
00:06:59,757 --> 00:07:01,007
And have you thought more about

102
00:07:02,385 --> 00:07:03,760
why you were locked up?

103
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,268
Who knows?

104
00:07:18,442 --> 00:07:20,193
I was wondering
if you could ask the doctor

105
00:07:20,278 --> 00:07:22,195
to increase my medication.

106
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:30,537
Arthur, you're on
seven different medications.

107
00:07:31,873 --> 00:07:34,457
Surely,
they must be doing something.

108
00:07:37,003 --> 00:07:40,172
I just don't want to
feel so bad anymore.

109
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,418
Would you please
stop bothering my kid?

110
00:08:21,589 --> 00:08:22,649
I wasn't bothering him.
I was...

111
00:08:22,673 --> 00:08:23,882
Just stop.

112
00:08:32,433 --> 00:08:34,226
What? You think that's funny?

113
00:08:42,526 --> 00:08:44,152
I'm sorry. I have a...

114
00:09:00,753 --> 00:09:01,953
I'm sorry.

115
00:10:40,686 --> 00:10:42,126
Happy,
did you check the mail

116
00:10:42,188 --> 00:10:43,521
before you came up?

117
00:10:43,689 --> 00:10:45,273
Yeah, Mom.

118
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:47,734
Nothing.

119
00:10:50,905 --> 00:10:52,507
And finally, tonight,

120
00:10:52,531 --> 00:10:54,532
just when you thought
it couldn't get any worse,

121
00:10:54,867 --> 00:10:55,992
authorities are saying

122
00:10:56,077 --> 00:10:58,536
the city is under siege
by scores of rats.

123
00:10:58,704 --> 00:10:59,996
And not just any rats,

124
00:11:00,081 --> 00:11:02,207
but super rats,
who are hard to kill.

125
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:04,292
He must not be
getting my letters.

126
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,460
Yeah.

127
00:11:05,669 --> 00:11:07,712
It's Thomas Wayne, Mom.

128
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,297
He's a busy man.

129
00:11:09,465 --> 00:11:13,176
Please. I worked
for that family for years.

130
00:11:13,636 --> 00:11:15,637
The least he could do
is write back.

131
00:11:17,181 --> 00:11:20,350
Here.
Don't get all worked up. Eat.

132
00:11:20,518 --> 00:11:21,518
You need to eat.

133
00:11:21,685 --> 00:11:25,313
You need to eat.
Look how skinny you are.

134
00:11:26,857 --> 00:11:28,543
Both victims
were taken to Gotham General.

135
00:11:28,567 --> 00:11:29,692
Sounds like

136
00:11:29,777 --> 00:11:30,921
the city needs to
find the Pied Piper.

137
00:11:30,945 --> 00:11:33,613
He'll make a great mayor.
Everybody says so.

138
00:11:34,156 --> 00:11:37,575
Oh, yeah. Everybody who?
Who do you talk to?

139
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,537
Well, everybody on the news.

140
00:11:40,704 --> 00:11:42,872
He's the only one
who could save the city.

141
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,374
He owes it to us.

142
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:48,795
Come sit. It's starting.

143
00:11:48,963 --> 00:11:50,755
Yay, Murray.

144
00:11:51,632 --> 00:11:55,051
From
NCB Studios in Gotham City,

145
00:11:55,219 --> 00:11:58,513
it's Live with Murray Franklin!

146
00:11:59,515 --> 00:12:02,600
Tonight, Murray welcomes
Sandra Winger...

147
00:12:02,768 --> 00:12:03,977
Oh, Sandra Winger's on.

148
00:12:04,145 --> 00:12:07,272
And the piano stylings
of Yeldon and Chantel.

149
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,566
Joining Murray, as always,

150
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:12,318
Ellis Drane
and his jazz orchestra.

151
00:12:12,486 --> 00:12:15,155
And now, without further ado,

152
00:12:15,322 --> 00:12:18,074
Murray Franklin.

153
00:12:30,337 --> 00:12:32,213
Thank you.

154
00:12:33,382 --> 00:12:34,507
Thank you.

155
00:12:34,675 --> 00:12:37,010
We got a great-looking
audience tonight.

156
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:39,304
Yeah!

157
00:12:39,472 --> 00:12:41,181
Wow. Thank you. Thank you.

158
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,682
Thank you.

159
00:12:43,309 --> 00:12:45,768
So, everybody's heard
about the super rats that

160
00:12:45,853 --> 00:12:48,271
- are in Gotham now, right?
- Yeah.

161
00:12:48,355 --> 00:12:51,733
Well, today, the mayor said
he has a solution.

162
00:12:51,901 --> 00:12:54,651
You ready for this?
Super cats.

163
00:12:59,283 --> 00:13:00,844
But in all seriousness,
I mean, these rats are...

164
00:13:00,868 --> 00:13:02,368
I love you, Murray!

165
00:13:04,246 --> 00:13:05,538
I love you, too.

166
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:09,042
Hey, Bobby,
would you put the lights on?

167
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:10,210
Who is that?

168
00:13:10,377 --> 00:13:12,545
Was that you?
You wanna stand up, please?

169
00:13:12,713 --> 00:13:14,631
Stand up for me.

170
00:13:14,798 --> 00:13:15,798
Go ahead.

171
00:13:20,971 --> 00:13:22,680
What's your name?

172
00:13:23,224 --> 00:13:25,225
Hi, Murray. Arthur.

173
00:13:25,392 --> 00:13:27,060
- Arthur?
- My name's Arthur.

174
00:13:27,228 --> 00:13:28,955
Oh, okay. Well, there's
something special about you,

175
00:13:28,979 --> 00:13:30,021
Arthur, I could tell.

176
00:13:30,189 --> 00:13:31,189
Where are you from?

177
00:13:31,357 --> 00:13:33,066
I live right here in the city

178
00:13:33,234 --> 00:13:35,194
with my mother.

179
00:13:36,278 --> 00:13:37,464
Okay, hold on.
Hold on.

180
00:13:37,488 --> 00:13:38,632
There's nothing funny
about that.

181
00:13:38,656 --> 00:13:41,324
I lived with my mother before
I made it. Just me and her.

182
00:13:41,492 --> 00:13:44,327
I'm that kid whose father went
out for a pack of cigarettes,

183
00:13:44,495 --> 00:13:46,545
and he never came back.
Aww.

184
00:13:46,705 --> 00:13:48,706
I know
what that's like, Murray.

185
00:13:48,874 --> 00:13:51,417
I've been the man of the house
for as long as I can remember.

186
00:13:51,585 --> 00:13:53,336
I take good care of my mother.

187
00:13:57,508 --> 00:14:00,426
All that sacrifice,
she must love you very much.

188
00:14:00,594 --> 00:14:01,594
She does.

189
00:14:02,429 --> 00:14:06,307
She always tells me to smile
and put on a happy face.

190
00:14:06,475 --> 00:14:09,102
She says I was put here
to spread joy and laughter.

191
00:14:09,186 --> 00:14:10,645
Aww.

192
00:14:13,023 --> 00:14:14,023
Wow.

193
00:14:16,777 --> 00:14:19,529
I like that. I like that
a lot. Come on down.

194
00:14:19,697 --> 00:14:22,532
Come on. For that,
you gotta come down.

195
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,177
Come on! Come on.

196
00:14:32,084 --> 00:14:33,084
Come on.

197
00:14:48,309 --> 00:14:50,560
Okay, we got a big show
tonight. Stay tuned.

198
00:14:50,728 --> 00:14:52,520
We'll be right back.

199
00:14:53,272 --> 00:14:54,689
That was great, Arthur.
Thank you.

200
00:14:54,857 --> 00:14:56,608
I mean, I loved hearing
what you had to say.

201
00:14:56,775 --> 00:14:57,984
It made my day.

202
00:14:58,152 --> 00:14:59,360
Thanks, Murray.

203
00:14:59,778 --> 00:15:01,446
You see all this,
the lights, the show,

204
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:02,822
the audience, all that stuff?

205
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:04,217
I'd give it all up
in a heartbeat

206
00:15:04,241 --> 00:15:05,408
to have a kid like you.

207
00:15:47,993 --> 00:15:50,013
- What's up, ladies?
- Hey, Randall. What's up?

208
00:15:50,037 --> 00:15:51,704
Another day in chuckle town.

209
00:15:51,872 --> 00:15:52,872
Yup.

210
00:15:56,418 --> 00:15:57,502
You okay?

211
00:15:59,463 --> 00:16:01,964
I heard about
the beatdown you took.

212
00:16:02,716 --> 00:16:03,800
Fucking savages.

213
00:16:05,344 --> 00:16:07,762
It was just a bunch of kids.
I should have left it alone.

214
00:16:07,846 --> 00:16:08,888
No.

215
00:16:09,056 --> 00:16:11,391
They'll take everything
from you if you do that.

216
00:16:11,558 --> 00:16:12,892
All the crazy shit out there.

217
00:16:13,435 --> 00:16:15,144
They're animals.

218
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:20,942
You know what?

219
00:16:26,198 --> 00:16:27,198
Here.

220
00:16:28,867 --> 00:16:31,650
What is it?
Take it.

221
00:16:32,579 --> 00:16:33,663
It's for you.

222
00:16:38,127 --> 00:16:40,086
You gotta
protect yourself out there.

223
00:16:40,838 --> 00:16:42,338
Otherwise,
you're gonna get fucked.

224
00:16:43,966 --> 00:16:45,133
Randall,

225
00:16:46,593 --> 00:16:49,220
I'm not supposed to have a gun.

226
00:16:50,764 --> 00:16:52,223
Don't sweat it, Art.

227
00:16:53,016 --> 00:16:54,267
No one has to know.

228
00:16:54,435 --> 00:16:56,769
And you can pay me back
some other time.

229
00:16:56,937 --> 00:16:58,146
You know you're my boy.

230
00:17:00,357 --> 00:17:01,357
Arthur,

231
00:17:01,984 --> 00:17:03,484
Hoyt wants to
see you in his office.

232
00:17:04,236 --> 00:17:06,738
Hey, Gary. You know
what I've always wondered?

233
00:17:06,905 --> 00:17:08,030
No idea.

234
00:17:08,198 --> 00:17:10,032
Do you people call it
miniature golf

235
00:17:10,117 --> 00:17:11,576
or is it just golf to you?

236
00:17:16,832 --> 00:17:18,332
Punch him in the dick,
Gary.

237
00:17:35,309 --> 00:17:36,934
Hello, Hoyt.

238
00:17:37,102 --> 00:17:39,604
Gary said you wanted to see me.

239
00:17:39,772 --> 00:17:42,690
How's the comedy career?
Are you a famous stand-up yet?

240
00:17:42,775 --> 00:17:43,816
Not quite.

241
00:17:43,984 --> 00:17:46,110
Just been
working on my material.

242
00:17:46,278 --> 00:17:48,196
No, don't sit.
This'll be quick.

243
00:17:48,363 --> 00:17:49,864
Look, I like you, Arthur.

244
00:17:50,032 --> 00:17:51,449
You know, a lot of the guys,

245
00:17:51,533 --> 00:17:53,173
they think you're a freak,
but I like you.

246
00:17:54,077 --> 00:17:55,703
I don't even know
why I like you.

247
00:17:56,413 --> 00:17:57,997
But I got another complaint.

248
00:17:58,707 --> 00:18:01,501
It's starting to piss me off.
Kenny's Music.

249
00:18:01,668 --> 00:18:03,503
The guy said you disappeared.

250
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:05,046
Never even returned his sign.

251
00:18:05,923 --> 00:18:07,715
Because I got jumped.

252
00:18:08,091 --> 00:18:09,801
Didn't you hear?

253
00:18:09,968 --> 00:18:11,719
For a sign?

254
00:18:11,887 --> 00:18:14,055
That's bullshit.
It doesn't even make sense.

255
00:18:14,223 --> 00:18:16,182
Just get him his sign back.

256
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:18,726
He's going out of business,
for God's sake, Arthur.

257
00:18:18,894 --> 00:18:20,686
Why would I keep his sign?

258
00:18:20,854 --> 00:18:23,606
How the fuck do I know?
Why does anybody do anything?

259
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,901
If you don't return the sign,

260
00:18:27,069 --> 00:18:29,111
I gotta take it
out of your paycheck.

261
00:18:30,197 --> 00:18:31,322
Are we clear?

262
00:18:32,866 --> 00:18:35,618
Listen, I'm trying to help you.

263
00:18:35,786 --> 00:18:37,745
Okay? And I'll tell you
something else.

264
00:18:37,913 --> 00:18:39,288
The other guys,

265
00:18:39,373 --> 00:18:41,213
they don't feel comfortable
around you, Arthur,

266
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:43,251
because people
think you're weird.

267
00:18:43,418 --> 00:18:46,254
Okay? And I can't
have that around me.

268
00:19:36,054 --> 00:19:37,096
Wait, wait, wait.

269
00:19:37,264 --> 00:19:38,264
Wait.

270
00:19:41,518 --> 00:19:42,643
Thank you.

271
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:07,251
This building is so awful,
isn't it?

272
00:20:09,129 --> 00:20:11,589
This building is so awful,
right, Mommy?

273
00:20:11,757 --> 00:20:14,175
Yes, we can hear you, GiGi.

274
00:20:14,343 --> 00:20:16,677
It's so awful, Mommy.

275
00:20:18,388 --> 00:20:19,388
Right, Mommy?

276
00:20:27,356 --> 00:20:28,856
- Good night.
- This building's

277
00:20:29,024 --> 00:20:30,209
- so awful, isn't it?
- Mmm-hmm.

278
00:20:35,697 --> 00:20:36,697
Hey.

279
00:20:43,413 --> 00:20:44,413
Come on.

280
00:20:54,257 --> 00:20:58,010
The moon is a silver dollar

281
00:20:58,553 --> 00:21:01,097
Shining up in the sky

282
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:03,724
That's the dream we can buy...

283
00:21:03,809 --> 00:21:05,129
- Look up.
- Mmm.

284
00:21:05,268 --> 00:21:07,269
Maybe the mailman's
throwing them away.

285
00:21:07,437 --> 00:21:10,314
Mom, why are these letters
so important to you?

286
00:21:11,233 --> 00:21:12,513
What do you think he's gonna do?

287
00:21:12,609 --> 00:21:13,943
He's gonna help us.

288
00:21:14,861 --> 00:21:19,031
But you worked for him,
what, 30 years ago?

289
00:21:19,199 --> 00:21:21,075
Why would he help us?

290
00:21:21,243 --> 00:21:23,828
Because Thomas Wayne
is a good man.

291
00:21:24,705 --> 00:21:27,289
If he knew how we were living,

292
00:21:27,457 --> 00:21:30,918
if he saw this place,
it would make him sick.

293
00:21:32,295 --> 00:21:34,964
I can't explain it to you
any better than that.

294
00:21:36,842 --> 00:21:38,718
I don't want you worrying
about money, Mom.

295
00:21:40,053 --> 00:21:41,178
Or me.

296
00:21:41,638 --> 00:21:42,805
Everybody's telling me

297
00:21:42,889 --> 00:21:45,516
that my stand-up's
ready for the big clubs.

298
00:21:46,727 --> 00:21:49,311
But, Happy, what makes you
think you could do that?

299
00:21:49,813 --> 00:21:51,522
- What do you mean?
- I mean...

300
00:21:52,691 --> 00:21:54,984
Don't you have to be funny
to be a comedian?

301
00:22:24,848 --> 00:22:26,807
Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom

302
00:22:26,892 --> 00:22:29,226
The world is in a mess

303
00:22:29,311 --> 00:22:31,604
With politics and taxes
And people grinding axes

304
00:22:31,688 --> 00:22:32,855
There's no happiness

305
00:22:34,066 --> 00:22:36,400
Happiness is not a riddle

306
00:22:36,485 --> 00:22:39,278
When I'm listening to that
Big bass fiddle

307
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:52,625
Slap that bass
Slap it till its dizzy

308
00:22:52,709 --> 00:22:55,044
Slap that bass
Keep the rhythm busy

309
00:22:55,128 --> 00:22:57,922
Zoom, zoom, zoom
Misery, you've got to go...

310
00:22:58,632 --> 00:22:59,882
Hey, what's your name?

311
00:23:01,093 --> 00:23:02,093
Arthur.

312
00:23:03,095 --> 00:23:06,347
Hey, Arthur,
you're a really good dancer.

313
00:23:07,057 --> 00:23:08,182
I know.

314
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:10,976
You know who's not?
Him.

315
00:23:16,608 --> 00:23:18,526
Happy, what was that?
Are you okay?

316
00:23:18,693 --> 00:23:19,735
Mom, what?

317
00:23:19,903 --> 00:23:22,029
That noise!
Did you hear that noise?

318
00:23:22,197 --> 00:23:24,448
I'm watching an old war movie!

319
00:23:24,616 --> 00:23:26,117
Turn it down!

320
00:23:26,368 --> 00:23:27,618
Um...

321
00:23:32,499 --> 00:23:34,166
Sorry, Mom.

322
00:23:46,888 --> 00:23:48,013
You good?

323
00:24:55,373 --> 00:24:57,917
It's nice to see these couples
out at my show.

324
00:24:58,877 --> 00:25:01,086
I have a wife.
We love to role-play.

325
00:25:01,171 --> 00:25:03,881
- Ooh!
- Yes, yes, very sexy.

326
00:25:04,049 --> 00:25:05,549
My favorite one right now is

327
00:25:05,717 --> 00:25:08,677
professor and senior
who really needs

328
00:25:08,762 --> 00:25:12,450
to pass my class to graduate.
Yes.

329
00:25:13,975 --> 00:25:15,351
So, I'll tell you how I operate.

330
00:25:15,518 --> 00:25:16,644
I'm a professor at

331
00:25:16,728 --> 00:25:18,247
a prestigious
New England university...

332
00:25:19,773 --> 00:25:23,651
And my wife is a senior
in my "Intro To Western Civ."

333
00:25:25,695 --> 00:25:26,862
I know. I know.

334
00:25:27,447 --> 00:25:30,199
Why is she a senior in the
intro? I didn't buy it either.

335
00:25:31,326 --> 00:25:33,160
So, she comes to me
during my office hours.

336
00:25:34,329 --> 00:25:35,929
It's Monday and Wednesday,
three to five.

337
00:25:36,039 --> 00:25:38,290
She says,
"Excuse me, Professor Lewis."

338
00:25:38,458 --> 00:25:40,376
I can't use my real last name
at this college

339
00:25:40,543 --> 00:25:42,086
'cause they don't hire Jews.

340
00:25:43,922 --> 00:25:45,172
It's something I'll address

341
00:25:45,257 --> 00:25:46,882
once I have tenure,
but for now...

342
00:25:47,592 --> 00:25:49,218
She says,
"Excuse me, Professor Lewis,

343
00:25:49,386 --> 00:25:50,613
I think I might be
in danger of failing

344
00:25:50,637 --> 00:25:51,845
your 'Intro to Western Civ, '

345
00:25:52,013 --> 00:25:53,138
and I just want you to know

346
00:25:53,223 --> 00:25:54,974
I'm willing to do
anything to pass."

347
00:25:55,767 --> 00:25:59,186
And I said, "Anything?"
And she said...

348
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,963
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

349
00:27:08,965 --> 00:27:10,507
Were you following me today?

350
00:27:14,054 --> 00:27:15,804
Yeah.

351
00:27:17,682 --> 00:27:19,516
I thought that was you.

352
00:27:20,352 --> 00:27:22,770
I was hoping you'd come in
and rob the place.

353
00:27:24,814 --> 00:27:26,357
I have a gun.

354
00:27:26,524 --> 00:27:28,150
I could come by tomorrow.

355
00:27:31,613 --> 00:27:33,072
You're so funny, Arthur.

356
00:27:35,325 --> 00:27:36,617
Yeah.

357
00:27:36,785 --> 00:27:39,286
You know, I do stand-up comedy.

358
00:27:39,454 --> 00:27:42,206
You should maybe
come see a show sometime.

359
00:27:42,916 --> 00:27:44,249
I could do that.

360
00:27:44,417 --> 00:27:45,542
Yeah?

361
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:47,503
Yeah. You'll let me know when?

362
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:48,670
Yeah.

363
00:27:55,595 --> 00:27:57,805
If you're happy
and you know it

364
00:27:57,889 --> 00:27:59,056
Wiggle your ears

365
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:00,140
Wiggle your ears

366
00:28:00,225 --> 00:28:02,434
If you're happy
and you know it

367
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:04,770
Wiggle your ears

368
00:28:04,938 --> 00:28:07,189
If you're happy and you know it

369
00:28:07,273 --> 00:28:09,358
And you really want to show it

370
00:28:09,526 --> 00:28:11,527
If you're happy and you know it

371
00:28:11,611 --> 00:28:12,736
Wiggle your ears

372
00:28:14,155 --> 00:28:16,115
If you're happy and you know it

373
00:28:16,199 --> 00:28:18,659
Stomp your feet

374
00:28:18,743 --> 00:28:20,744
If you're happy and you know it

375
00:28:20,829 --> 00:28:23,122
Stomp your feet

376
00:28:23,289 --> 00:28:25,499
If you're happy and you know it

377
00:28:25,583 --> 00:28:27,709
And you really want to show it

378
00:28:27,877 --> 00:28:30,003
If you're happy and you know it

379
00:28:30,088 --> 00:28:31,338
Stomp your feet

380
00:28:32,715 --> 00:28:34,216
If you're happy and you know it

381
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,717
Shout "hurray"

382
00:28:35,885 --> 00:28:37,052
Shout "hurray"

383
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:39,138
If you're happy and you know it

384
00:28:39,222 --> 00:28:40,639
Shout "hurray"

385
00:28:40,807 --> 00:28:41,867
Shout "hurray"

386
00:28:41,891 --> 00:28:43,350
If you're happy and you know it

387
00:28:43,435 --> 00:28:45,115
And you really want to

388
00:28:45,603 --> 00:28:49,231
Hoyt, please, I love this job.

389
00:28:49,399 --> 00:28:51,608
Arthur, I need to know why

390
00:28:51,693 --> 00:28:53,819
you brought a gun
into a kids' hospital.

391
00:28:53,987 --> 00:28:56,947
It's a prop.
It's part of my act now.

392
00:28:57,115 --> 00:28:58,949
That's bullshit. Bullshit.

393
00:28:59,117 --> 00:29:01,201
What kind of clown
carries a fucking gun?

394
00:29:01,911 --> 00:29:03,328
Besides, Randall told me

395
00:29:03,413 --> 00:29:06,373
you tried to buy a .38
off him last week.

396
00:29:06,541 --> 00:29:07,583
Randall told you that?

397
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:10,878
You're a fuck-up, Arthur,
and a liar.

398
00:29:11,045 --> 00:29:12,125
You're fired!

399
00:29:38,281 --> 00:29:39,508
Jefferson Street.

400
00:29:39,532 --> 00:29:41,033
Next stop, Ninth Ave.

401
00:29:44,037 --> 00:29:45,473
I'm telling you,
she wanted my number.

402
00:29:45,497 --> 00:29:46,622
We should've just stayed.

403
00:29:46,789 --> 00:29:49,458
You're dreaming, man.
She wasn't interested at all.

404
00:29:49,626 --> 00:29:51,979
Are you nuts? Did you
see how close we were dancing?

405
00:29:52,003 --> 00:29:53,086
She was in love.

406
00:29:53,254 --> 00:29:54,774
She couldn't wait to
get away from you.

407
00:29:54,881 --> 00:29:57,216
Ryan! Ryan, am I crazy?
Tell him what you saw.

408
00:29:59,802 --> 00:30:01,882
Hey,
you want some French fries?

409
00:30:04,349 --> 00:30:05,933
Hello?

410
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:08,393
Talking to you. Hey.

411
00:30:08,561 --> 00:30:10,103
No, thank you.

412
00:30:13,066 --> 00:30:14,316
You sure?

413
00:30:16,194 --> 00:30:17,319
They're real good.

414
00:30:20,156 --> 00:30:22,908
Don't ignore him.
He's being nice to you.

415
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,285
Whoo...

416
00:30:49,894 --> 00:30:51,520
Is something funny, asshole?

417
00:30:55,733 --> 00:30:57,109
Bitch!

418
00:31:03,866 --> 00:31:06,868
Isn't it rich?

419
00:31:07,745 --> 00:31:10,163
Are we a pair?

420
00:31:12,625 --> 00:31:15,294
Me here at last on the ground

421
00:31:15,461 --> 00:31:18,463
And you in mid-air

422
00:31:18,631 --> 00:31:21,633
Send in the clowns

423
00:31:25,763 --> 00:31:27,556
Isn't it bliss?

424
00:31:29,017 --> 00:31:31,018
Don't you approve?

425
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:34,187
One who keeps tearing around

426
00:31:34,355 --> 00:31:37,190
And one who can't move

427
00:31:37,358 --> 00:31:40,527
Where are the clowns?

428
00:31:40,695 --> 00:31:44,406
There ought to be clowns

429
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:57,085
So, buddy, tell us,
what's so fucking funny?

430
00:31:57,253 --> 00:31:58,879
Nothing.

431
00:32:02,925 --> 00:32:04,217
I have... I have a condition.

432
00:32:04,927 --> 00:32:06,887
I'll tell you what you have,
you asshole.

433
00:32:06,971 --> 00:32:08,096
Whoa!

434
00:32:10,558 --> 00:32:11,975
Please, stop!

435
00:32:12,977 --> 00:32:14,978
We got a kicker, huh?

436
00:32:15,146 --> 00:32:16,938
Hey, hold him steady.
Hold him steady.

437
00:32:19,442 --> 00:32:21,109
Stay down, freak!

438
00:32:40,046 --> 00:32:41,505
Hey!

439
00:33:04,028 --> 00:33:05,130
Ninth Avenue.

440
00:33:05,154 --> 00:33:06,321
Next stop, Hunter's Point.

441
00:33:06,489 --> 00:33:07,823
Hey!

442
00:33:13,913 --> 00:33:15,706
Stand clear of
the closing doors.

443
00:33:52,702 --> 00:33:55,245
Shit. Shit.

444
00:36:48,753 --> 00:36:50,712
I read it was
a guy in full makeup.

445
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,340
No, it says right here
it was a mask.

446
00:36:53,507 --> 00:36:55,634
Either way, I think
it's good for business.

447
00:36:55,801 --> 00:36:58,136
They got clowns on the front
of every newspaper.

448
00:36:58,304 --> 00:36:59,512
Big man, what's the good word?

449
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,680
Hey.

450
00:37:03,809 --> 00:37:06,019
Hey, Arthur,
I heard what happened.

451
00:37:06,187 --> 00:37:07,479
Sorry, mate.

452
00:37:07,647 --> 00:37:08,647
Yeah.

453
00:37:09,315 --> 00:37:10,565
It doesn't seem fair,

454
00:37:10,733 --> 00:37:12,609
getting fired like that.

455
00:37:13,819 --> 00:37:14,903
Did you really bring a gun

456
00:37:14,987 --> 00:37:16,404
to the children's hospital,
Artie?

457
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:18,949
What the fuck
would you do that for?

458
00:37:19,116 --> 00:37:20,552
Is that part of
your new act, Arthur?

459
00:37:20,576 --> 00:37:21,678
If your dancing
doesn't do the trick,

460
00:37:21,702 --> 00:37:22,971
you're just gonna
shoot yourself?

461
00:37:24,372 --> 00:37:25,747
Why don't you
ask Randall about it?

462
00:37:26,749 --> 00:37:27,874
It was his gun.

463
00:37:28,334 --> 00:37:29,895
- What?
- I still owe you for that,

464
00:37:29,919 --> 00:37:30,961
don't I?

465
00:37:31,128 --> 00:37:32,879
What the fuck
are you talking about?

466
00:37:33,422 --> 00:37:35,215
Stop talking
out of your ass, Art.

467
00:37:40,346 --> 00:37:41,721
Oh, no!

468
00:37:43,474 --> 00:37:45,183
I forgot to punch out.

469
00:37:51,649 --> 00:37:53,650
And turns to sorrow

470
00:37:55,486 --> 00:37:59,030
King of all Hear me call

471
00:38:00,157 --> 00:38:04,744
Hear my name Carnival

472
00:38:15,506 --> 00:38:17,757
And as our city
tries to make sense

473
00:38:17,925 --> 00:38:21,386
of the brutal triple murder
on the subway last week,

474
00:38:21,554 --> 00:38:23,054
we're joined by Thomas Wayne.

475
00:38:23,222 --> 00:38:25,473
Happy, look,
Thomas Wayne's on TV.

476
00:38:25,641 --> 00:38:26,808
Yes, Mother.

477
00:38:26,976 --> 00:38:28,370
Thanks for
having me on, Chuck.

478
00:38:28,394 --> 00:38:29,686
They're asking him about

479
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:31,229
those horrible subway murders.

480
00:38:31,397 --> 00:38:32,677
Thank you, Thomas.
I know

481
00:38:32,732 --> 00:38:34,482
this is a difficult time
for you.

482
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:36,317
Why him?

483
00:38:36,485 --> 00:38:38,361
Looks like he's gained weight.

484
00:38:38,529 --> 00:38:40,609
Yes, all three worked
for Wayne Investments.

485
00:38:40,948 --> 00:38:42,615
Good, decent, educated.

486
00:38:42,783 --> 00:38:45,410
Although I didn't know
any of them personally.

487
00:38:47,121 --> 00:38:48,538
Like all Wayne employees,

488
00:38:48,622 --> 00:38:50,915
past and present,
they're family.

489
00:38:51,083 --> 00:38:52,803
Did you hear that?
I told you, we're family.

490
00:38:52,835 --> 00:38:54,312
There now seems to be

491
00:38:54,336 --> 00:38:56,588
a groundswell of anti-rich
sentiment in the city.

492
00:38:56,756 --> 00:38:58,923
It's almost as if
our less fortunate residents

493
00:38:59,008 --> 00:39:01,217
are taking the side
of the killer.

494
00:39:01,385 --> 00:39:03,053
Yes, and it's a shame.

495
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:04,512
It's one of the reasons why

496
00:39:04,597 --> 00:39:05,877
I'm considering a run for mayor.

497
00:39:06,682 --> 00:39:08,892
Gotham's lost its way.

498
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:10,810
What about the eyewitness report

499
00:39:10,895 --> 00:39:13,605
of the suspect being
a man in a clown mask?

500
00:39:13,773 --> 00:39:15,774
Well,
it makes total sense to me.

501
00:39:15,941 --> 00:39:18,181
What kind of coward would do
something that cold-blooded?

502
00:39:18,319 --> 00:39:20,153
Someone who hides behind a mask.

503
00:39:20,738 --> 00:39:22,197
Someone who is envious

504
00:39:22,281 --> 00:39:25,700
of those more fortunate
than themselves,

505
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:29,204
yet they're too scared
to show their own face.

506
00:39:29,371 --> 00:39:32,290
And until those kind of people
change for the better,

507
00:39:32,458 --> 00:39:36,044
those of us who have
made something of our lives

508
00:39:36,212 --> 00:39:38,546
will always look
at those who haven't

509
00:39:38,714 --> 00:39:40,840
as nothing but clowns.

510
00:39:42,468 --> 00:39:44,928
Thomas Wayne, thank you
for coming in this morning.

511
00:39:45,096 --> 00:39:46,096
It's not funny.

512
00:40:07,827 --> 00:40:10,078
I heard this song on the radio
the other day,

513
00:40:12,915 --> 00:40:16,918
and the guy was singing
that his name was Carnival.

514
00:40:18,087 --> 00:40:19,170
Arthur...

515
00:40:19,338 --> 00:40:20,505
Which is crazy,

516
00:40:22,883 --> 00:40:25,927
because that's
my clown name at work.

517
00:40:27,012 --> 00:40:29,472
And until a little while ago,

518
00:40:30,724 --> 00:40:33,226
it was like nobody ever saw me.

519
00:40:35,271 --> 00:40:37,647
Even I didn't know
if I really existed.

520
00:40:38,065 --> 00:40:40,441
Arthur, I have
some bad news for you.

521
00:40:43,779 --> 00:40:45,196
You don't listen, do you?

522
00:40:46,866 --> 00:40:50,869
I don't think
you ever really hear me.

523
00:40:51,954 --> 00:40:54,747
You just ask
the same questions every week.

524
00:40:54,915 --> 00:40:58,209
"How's your job? Are you
having any negative thoughts?"

525
00:40:59,253 --> 00:41:02,964
All I have are
negative thoughts,

526
00:41:03,132 --> 00:41:05,967
but you don't listen anyway.

527
00:41:06,135 --> 00:41:09,512
I said, for my whole life,

528
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:12,891
I didn't know
if I even really existed.

529
00:41:14,101 --> 00:41:15,810
But I do.

530
00:41:17,271 --> 00:41:21,191
And people are
starting to notice.

531
00:41:22,943 --> 00:41:24,694
They've cut our funding.

532
00:41:24,862 --> 00:41:26,529
We're closing down
our offices next week.

533
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,158
The city has cut funding
across the board.

534
00:41:30,242 --> 00:41:32,202
Social Services is part of that.

535
00:41:32,369 --> 00:41:34,412
This is the last time
we'll be meeting.

536
00:41:35,372 --> 00:41:36,539
Okay.

537
00:41:40,753 --> 00:41:42,833
They don't give a shit
about people like you, Arthur.

538
00:41:45,007 --> 00:41:46,424
And they really
don't give a shit

539
00:41:46,508 --> 00:41:48,468
about people like me, either.

540
00:41:51,722 --> 00:41:53,056
Fuck.

541
00:42:01,273 --> 00:42:03,775
How am I supposed to
get my medication now?

542
00:42:06,779 --> 00:42:08,363
Who do I talk to?

543
00:42:10,824 --> 00:42:12,617
I'm sorry, Arthur.

544
00:42:15,412 --> 00:42:18,957
I think... I think most women
look at sex like buying a car.

545
00:42:19,625 --> 00:42:22,043
You know, like, "Can I see
myself in this long-term?"

546
00:42:22,211 --> 00:42:24,212
"Is it safe?"

547
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:25,838
"Is it reliable?"

548
00:42:26,006 --> 00:42:28,258
"Could it kill me?"

549
00:42:28,342 --> 00:42:30,385
Most guys, we look at sex
like parking a car.

550
00:42:30,552 --> 00:42:32,929
We're like, "There's a spot."

551
00:42:33,097 --> 00:42:34,222
"There's another spot.

552
00:42:34,306 --> 00:42:35,533
"That would work."

553
00:42:35,557 --> 00:42:38,059
"Oh, I have to pay?
Never mind."

554
00:42:39,728 --> 00:42:42,480
"Handicapped?
I hope no one sees this."

555
00:42:45,192 --> 00:42:47,402
All right, that's my time.
Thank you very much, guys.

556
00:42:52,574 --> 00:42:54,742
One more time
for Sam Morril, y'all.

557
00:42:56,036 --> 00:42:57,829
All right, now,
this next comic describes

558
00:42:57,913 --> 00:43:00,039
himself as
a lifelong Gotham resident

559
00:43:00,207 --> 00:43:02,583
who from a young age
was always told

560
00:43:02,668 --> 00:43:03,710
that his purpose in life

561
00:43:03,877 --> 00:43:07,880
was to bring laughter and joy
into this cold, dark world.

562
00:43:08,465 --> 00:43:09,825
Um... Okay.

563
00:43:09,967 --> 00:43:12,218
Please help me welcome
Arthur Fleck, y'all.

564
00:43:12,303 --> 00:43:13,344
Arthur Fleck.

565
00:43:37,661 --> 00:43:40,204
Hello, it's good to be here.

566
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:07,940
I hated school when I was a kid.

567
00:44:23,457 --> 00:44:28,252
I hated school as a kid.

568
00:44:29,546 --> 00:44:31,214
My mother would say,

569
00:44:31,382 --> 00:44:32,882
"You should enjoy it.

570
00:44:32,966 --> 00:44:35,009
One day, you'll have to
work for a living."

571
00:44:36,470 --> 00:44:37,720
"No, I won't, Ma,

572
00:44:37,805 --> 00:44:39,472
I'm gonna be a comedian."

573
00:44:48,732 --> 00:44:49,899
Um...

574
00:44:52,111 --> 00:44:53,236
Here's one.

575
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:57,573
You know, I was
just thinking the other day,

576
00:44:57,658 --> 00:44:59,617
why are the rich people...

577
00:45:06,208 --> 00:45:07,602
Smile though your heart is aching

578
00:45:10,963 --> 00:45:15,341
Smile even though it's breaking

579
00:45:17,678 --> 00:45:23,391
When there are clouds in the sky
You'll get by

580
00:45:23,892 --> 00:45:28,938
If you smile
Through your fear and sorrow

581
00:45:29,022 --> 00:45:34,068
Smile and maybe tomorrow

582
00:45:34,278 --> 00:45:40,032
You'll see the sun
Come shining through for you

583
00:45:40,117 --> 00:45:41,451
You believe that shit?

584
00:45:43,287 --> 00:45:44,287
Fuck 'em.

585
00:45:46,331 --> 00:45:48,958
I think the guy
that did it is a hero.

586
00:45:51,128 --> 00:45:52,962
Three less pricks
in Gotham City,

587
00:45:53,422 --> 00:45:55,339
only a million more to go.

588
00:45:57,009 --> 00:45:59,844
You'll get by

589
00:45:59,970 --> 00:46:04,182
That's the time you must keep on trying

590
00:46:04,766 --> 00:46:08,936
Smile, what's the use of crying

591
00:46:09,104 --> 00:46:13,566
You'll find that
Life is still worthwhile

592
00:46:15,819 --> 00:46:19,697
If you just smile

593
00:46:27,206 --> 00:46:28,641
And, buddy, as always,

594
00:46:28,665 --> 00:46:29,790
thanks for the laughs.

595
00:46:29,958 --> 00:46:31,459
I'm sure we'll see you again.

596
00:46:31,627 --> 00:46:32,835
You know we'll be here, right?

597
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:34,212
I hope.

598
00:46:34,296 --> 00:46:37,965
Tomorrow night, we have
Diana Hudson, Greg Gordon,

599
00:46:38,133 --> 00:46:40,927
and animal expert, Hugh Little.

600
00:46:41,595 --> 00:46:42,887
Thanks for watching.

601
00:46:43,055 --> 00:46:45,348
Good night, and always remember,

602
00:46:45,516 --> 00:46:46,993
that's life.

603
00:46:51,230 --> 00:46:52,396
That's life.

604
00:46:57,236 --> 00:47:00,613
Momma, time to wake up
and go to bed.

605
00:47:00,697 --> 00:47:01,822
Hmm? Oh...

606
00:47:04,076 --> 00:47:05,535
Oh, Happy.

607
00:47:08,372 --> 00:47:10,039
Happy, I wrote a new letter.

608
00:47:10,207 --> 00:47:11,916
Come on, dance with me.

609
00:47:12,918 --> 00:47:15,294
For Thomas Wayne.
It's important.

610
00:47:24,221 --> 00:47:25,930
You smell like cologne.

611
00:47:26,098 --> 00:47:28,558
It's 'cause
I just had a big date.

612
00:47:28,725 --> 00:47:30,518
Oh.

613
00:47:33,230 --> 00:47:34,981
Just don't forget to mail it.

614
00:48:00,799 --> 00:48:02,527
The Murray Franklin
Show is taped live

615
00:48:02,551 --> 00:48:03,926
before a studio audience

616
00:48:04,094 --> 00:48:06,220
in beautiful downtown
Gotham City.

617
00:49:08,575 --> 00:49:11,160
You're gonna kill me. You're
gonna give me a heart attack!

618
00:49:11,328 --> 00:49:12,495
Don't give me your...

619
00:49:12,663 --> 00:49:14,497
No. No.

620
00:49:14,665 --> 00:49:17,625
I'm not talking to you
until you stop being angry!

621
00:49:17,793 --> 00:49:20,211
Okay.

622
00:49:24,925 --> 00:49:27,051
I'm not angry, Mom.

623
00:49:27,219 --> 00:49:30,853
I'm not angry.
Please.

624
00:49:31,973 --> 00:49:34,725
Mom, is this real?

625
00:49:38,397 --> 00:49:41,607
He's an extraordinary man,
Happy.

626
00:49:41,775 --> 00:49:44,110
He's a very powerful man.

627
00:49:45,654 --> 00:49:47,613
We were in love.

628
00:49:48,490 --> 00:49:50,408
He said it was best that
we not be together

629
00:49:50,492 --> 00:49:52,618
because of appearances.

630
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:58,457
And I could never
tell anyone because...

631
00:50:01,002 --> 00:50:02,461
Well, I signed some papers.

632
00:50:04,297 --> 00:50:05,923
And besides, you can imagine

633
00:50:06,007 --> 00:50:09,385
what people would say
about Thomas and me.

634
00:50:12,097 --> 00:50:13,472
What they'd say about you.

635
00:50:17,686 --> 00:50:19,603
What would they say, Mom?

636
00:52:08,755 --> 00:52:09,755
Hmm.

637
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:21,725
Hmm.

638
00:52:52,841 --> 00:52:53,883
Hi.

639
00:52:56,845 --> 00:52:58,220
What's your name?

640
00:52:59,472 --> 00:53:01,098
I'm Bruce.

641
00:53:02,183 --> 00:53:03,350
Bruce.

642
00:53:05,312 --> 00:53:06,562
I'm Arthur.

643
00:53:28,543 --> 00:53:29,919
That's better.

644
00:53:30,837 --> 00:53:32,421
Bruce! Bruce!

645
00:53:33,924 --> 00:53:35,090
Get away from that man.

646
00:53:35,258 --> 00:53:37,384
It's okay. I'm a good guy.

647
00:53:37,552 --> 00:53:38,802
What are you doing?
Who are you?

648
00:53:39,429 --> 00:53:41,096
I'm here to see Mr. Wayne.

649
00:53:41,264 --> 00:53:43,766
Well, you shouldn't be
speaking to his son.

650
00:53:45,185 --> 00:53:46,495
Why did you give him
these flowers?

651
00:53:46,519 --> 00:53:47,728
No, they're not real.

652
00:53:49,481 --> 00:53:51,523
It's magic.

653
00:53:51,983 --> 00:53:53,400
I was just trying to
make him smile.

654
00:53:53,568 --> 00:53:55,402
Well, it's not funny, is it?

655
00:53:56,404 --> 00:53:57,613
Do I need to call the police?

656
00:53:57,781 --> 00:53:59,198
No. Please.

657
00:54:00,492 --> 00:54:03,702
My mother's name is Penny.
Penny Fleck.

658
00:54:03,870 --> 00:54:05,097
She used to work here years ago.

659
00:54:05,121 --> 00:54:07,206
Can you please tell Mr. Wayne
I need to see him?

660
00:54:08,375 --> 00:54:09,833
You are her son.

661
00:54:10,001 --> 00:54:11,001
Yeah.

662
00:54:11,670 --> 00:54:13,379
Did you know her?

663
00:54:17,008 --> 00:54:19,343
I know about the two of them.

664
00:54:19,928 --> 00:54:22,346
She told me everything.

665
00:54:24,224 --> 00:54:26,016
There's nothing to know.

666
00:54:27,143 --> 00:54:28,936
There is no "them."

667
00:54:29,896 --> 00:54:32,064
Your mother was delusional.

668
00:54:32,983 --> 00:54:34,066
She was a sick woman.

669
00:54:34,234 --> 00:54:36,276
Don't say that.

670
00:54:37,445 --> 00:54:38,862
Just go.

671
00:54:38,989 --> 00:54:39,989
Mmm?

672
00:54:40,115 --> 00:54:42,366
Before you
make a fool of yourself.

673
00:54:44,035 --> 00:54:46,704
Thomas Wayne is my father.

674
00:54:51,751 --> 00:54:52,751
He left me.

675
00:54:55,588 --> 00:54:56,948
Let go! Let go!

676
00:55:23,241 --> 00:55:25,075
Keep the respirations above 15.

677
00:55:25,243 --> 00:55:27,411
Slow and steady.
We got some stairs coming up.

678
00:55:28,663 --> 00:55:29,872
Mom?

679
00:55:30,707 --> 00:55:31,707
What happened?

680
00:55:31,875 --> 00:55:33,542
- Who are you?
- I'm her son.

681
00:55:33,626 --> 00:55:35,187
- What happened?
- You can probably help us out inside.

682
00:55:35,211 --> 00:55:36,628
We don't know what happened yet.

683
00:55:36,713 --> 00:55:38,691
- Hop in the back of the ambulance.
- Step.

684
00:55:38,715 --> 00:55:40,026
One more.
We got one more lift.

685
00:55:40,050 --> 00:55:41,091
I'm getting

686
00:55:41,176 --> 00:55:42,403
a little resistance here,
Michael.

687
00:55:45,096 --> 00:55:46,096
Lift.

688
00:55:51,644 --> 00:55:52,978
I'm right here.

689
00:55:53,354 --> 00:55:54,563
Excuse me, sir.

690
00:55:54,814 --> 00:55:55,916
Does your mother take
any medications?

691
00:55:55,940 --> 00:55:57,024
- No.
- Excuse me,

692
00:55:57,108 --> 00:55:58,188
- I couldn't hear you.
- No.

693
00:55:58,234 --> 00:55:59,879
Sir, when was the last time
you spoke to her?

694
00:55:59,903 --> 00:56:01,070
I don't know.

695
00:56:45,990 --> 00:56:47,199
Mr. Fleck.

696
00:56:48,576 --> 00:56:50,536
Sorry to bother you.
I'm Detective Garrity.

697
00:56:50,620 --> 00:56:52,913
This is my partner,
Detective Burke.

698
00:56:53,331 --> 00:56:55,999
We had a few questions for
you, but you weren't home,

699
00:56:57,502 --> 00:56:59,002
so we spoke with your mother.

700
00:57:00,755 --> 00:57:01,755
Oh.

701
00:57:02,924 --> 00:57:04,341
What did you say to her?

702
00:57:04,509 --> 00:57:05,509
Did you do this?

703
00:57:05,677 --> 00:57:06,677
What? No.

704
00:57:06,845 --> 00:57:09,304
No, no, no. We just
asked her some questions,

705
00:57:09,472 --> 00:57:10,973
and she got hysterical.

706
00:57:11,141 --> 00:57:12,891
Hyperventilating,

707
00:57:13,059 --> 00:57:14,328
collapsed and
hit her head pretty hard.

708
00:57:14,352 --> 00:57:16,478
Yeah. The doctor said
she had a stroke.

709
00:57:17,105 --> 00:57:18,939
We're sorry to hear about that.

710
00:57:19,816 --> 00:57:22,651
But, like I said, I still have
some questions for you.

711
00:57:22,819 --> 00:57:24,099
They're about
the subway killings

712
00:57:24,154 --> 00:57:25,195
that happened last week.

713
00:57:25,363 --> 00:57:26,655
You've heard about them, right?

714
00:57:26,823 --> 00:57:27,906
Yeah.

715
00:57:28,074 --> 00:57:29,074
It's horrible.

716
00:57:29,242 --> 00:57:30,450
Right.

717
00:57:31,411 --> 00:57:34,538
So, we spoke with your boss
over at Haha's.

718
00:57:34,706 --> 00:57:36,748
He said you were fired
for bringing a gun

719
00:57:36,833 --> 00:57:38,292
into the children's hospital.

720
00:57:39,794 --> 00:57:41,795
- Is that true, Mr. Fleck?
- It was a prop.

721
00:57:41,963 --> 00:57:43,505
It's part of my act.

722
00:57:43,923 --> 00:57:45,257
I'm a party clown.

723
00:57:45,425 --> 00:57:47,342
All right.
So, why were you fired?

724
00:57:50,638 --> 00:57:53,182
They said I wasn't funny enough.

725
00:57:53,349 --> 00:57:55,309
Can you imagine that?

726
00:57:55,476 --> 00:57:59,313
If you don't mind, I have to
go take care of my mother.

727
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:01,732
Your boss also
gave us one of your cards.

728
00:58:03,943 --> 00:58:06,278
This condition of yours,
the laughing,

729
00:58:07,030 --> 00:58:08,363
is it real,

730
00:58:08,531 --> 00:58:10,365
or some sort of clown thing?

731
00:58:10,909 --> 00:58:13,410
- A clown thing?
- Yeah.

732
00:58:13,828 --> 00:58:16,121
I mean, is it part of your act?

733
00:58:18,708 --> 00:58:20,042
What do you think?

734
00:58:25,965 --> 00:58:27,049
It's exit only.

735
00:58:51,532 --> 00:58:53,533
She's gonna be okay.

736
00:58:57,997 --> 00:58:59,706
I'm gonna get a coffee.

737
00:59:00,416 --> 00:59:01,416
You want one?

738
00:59:01,584 --> 00:59:02,584
Yeah.

739
00:59:15,723 --> 00:59:18,684
So, the other night,
I told my youngest son Billy,

740
00:59:18,851 --> 00:59:21,311
you know, the new one,
the not-so-bright one.

741
00:59:22,146 --> 00:59:23,647
I told him, "The garbage strike

742
00:59:23,731 --> 00:59:24,982
is still going on, Billy."

743
00:59:25,191 --> 00:59:27,234
And he says, and I'm
not kidding, Billy says,

744
00:59:27,402 --> 00:59:29,362
"So, where are we gonna get
all our garbage from?"

745
00:59:36,744 --> 00:59:39,204
And finally,
in a world where everyone

746
00:59:39,289 --> 00:59:40,622
thinks they could do my job,

747
00:59:40,790 --> 00:59:43,000
we got this video tape
from Pogo's Comedy Club,

748
00:59:43,084 --> 00:59:44,209
right here in Gotham.

749
00:59:44,377 --> 00:59:46,337
Here's a guy who thinks
if you just keep laughing,

750
00:59:46,462 --> 00:59:48,171
it'll somehow make you funny.

751
00:59:48,256 --> 00:59:49,589
Check out this joker.

752
00:59:55,346 --> 00:59:56,388
Oh, my God.

753
00:59:56,472 --> 01:00:00,017
I hated school as a kid.

754
01:00:00,893 --> 01:00:03,937
But my mother would always say,

755
01:00:04,105 --> 01:00:05,689
"You should enjoy it.

756
01:00:05,773 --> 01:00:07,899
One day, you'll have to
work for a living."

757
01:00:08,693 --> 01:00:10,110
"No, I won't, Ma.

758
01:00:10,194 --> 01:00:11,903
I'm gonna be a comedian."

759
01:00:18,244 --> 01:00:20,329
You shoulda listened
to your mother.

760
01:00:22,582 --> 01:00:24,166
Hey, one more.
One more, Bobby.

761
01:00:24,334 --> 01:00:26,752
All right, let's see one more.
I love this guy.

762
01:00:27,587 --> 01:00:28,587
It's funny,

763
01:00:29,464 --> 01:00:31,590
when I was a little boy

764
01:00:31,758 --> 01:00:34,593
and told people
I was gonna be a comedian,

765
01:00:34,761 --> 01:00:36,803
everyone laughed at me.

766
01:00:36,971 --> 01:00:39,765
Well, no one's laughing now.

767
01:00:43,269 --> 01:00:45,145
You can say that again, pal.

768
01:00:50,943 --> 01:00:53,779
All right, we got a great show
for you tonight.

769
01:00:53,946 --> 01:00:57,115
Chuck Conby is here,
actress Joanne Mulligan,

770
01:00:57,283 --> 01:01:01,119
and new music from
Mel Rubin and the Stiffs.

771
01:01:07,085 --> 01:01:09,628
As tensions mount
around the metro area,

772
01:01:09,796 --> 01:01:13,382
Mayor Stokes has pleaded
for cooler heads to prevail.

773
01:01:13,549 --> 01:01:15,133
City services
have been affected,

774
01:01:15,301 --> 01:01:17,302
and some businesses have decided

775
01:01:17,387 --> 01:01:20,180
to remain closed
amid the unrest.

776
01:01:20,348 --> 01:01:22,933
Chuck Stevens filed this report.

777
01:01:23,101 --> 01:01:24,328
The anger and resentment

778
01:01:24,352 --> 01:01:25,788
that's been building
in the city for weeks

779
01:01:25,812 --> 01:01:27,813
seems close to exploding.

780
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:30,023
Protesters,
many dressed as clowns,

781
01:01:30,108 --> 01:01:31,233
took to the streets today

782
01:01:31,442 --> 01:01:33,235
in one of
several planned demonstrations

783
01:01:33,319 --> 01:01:34,861
taking on the city's elite,

784
01:01:35,029 --> 01:01:36,780
including a massive rally
outside

785
01:01:36,864 --> 01:01:39,282
tomorrow night's
benefit at Wayne Hall.

786
01:01:39,450 --> 01:01:41,095
What's the point of all this?

787
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:42,953
- the rich.
- Thomas Wayne.

788
01:01:43,037 --> 01:01:44,723
That's what this whole
thing is about.

789
01:01:44,747 --> 01:01:46,623
the whole system.

790
01:01:46,791 --> 01:01:47,935
Wayne,
who recently announced

791
01:01:47,959 --> 01:01:49,167
he is running for mayor,

792
01:01:49,335 --> 01:01:51,044
will be attending the benefit.

793
01:01:51,212 --> 01:01:53,213
You might remember
it was Thomas Wayne

794
01:01:53,381 --> 01:01:54,756
who first referred to

795
01:01:54,841 --> 01:01:57,634
many of Gotham's residents
as "clowns."

796
01:01:57,802 --> 01:02:00,804
Today, he offered little in
the way of an apology.

797
01:02:00,972 --> 01:02:02,222
Well, what I will say is,

798
01:02:02,306 --> 01:02:03,575
there's something wrong
with those people.

799
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:04,599
I am here to help them.

800
01:02:04,767 --> 01:02:06,120
I'm gonna
lift them out of poverty,

801
01:02:06,144 --> 01:02:07,561
help make their lives better.

802
01:02:07,728 --> 01:02:08,895
That is why I'm running.

803
01:02:09,063 --> 01:02:11,815
And they may not realize it,
but I'm their only hope.

804
01:02:27,623 --> 01:02:30,333
Down with Wayne!
Down with Wayne!

805
01:02:30,418 --> 01:02:33,170
Down with Wayne!
Down with Wayne!

806
01:05:13,748 --> 01:05:14,831
Can I help you, pal?

807
01:05:17,084 --> 01:05:18,752
I don't know what to say.

808
01:05:22,381 --> 01:05:24,591
Do you want an autograph
or something?

809
01:05:24,759 --> 01:05:25,759
No.

810
01:05:31,891 --> 01:05:33,433
My name is Arthur.

811
01:05:35,019 --> 01:05:36,645
Penny Fleck is my mother.

812
01:05:38,022 --> 01:05:39,022
Jesus.

813
01:05:40,107 --> 01:05:41,947
You're the guy that came to
my house yesterday.

814
01:05:43,361 --> 01:05:44,611
Yes.

815
01:05:45,154 --> 01:05:47,030
I'm sorry I just showed up.

816
01:05:47,198 --> 01:05:48,657
But my mother
told me everything,

817
01:05:48,741 --> 01:05:50,408
and I had to talk to you.

818
01:05:50,576 --> 01:05:52,494
Look, pal, I'm not your father.

819
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:54,579
What's wrong with you?

820
01:05:56,248 --> 01:05:57,791
Look at us.

821
01:05:59,293 --> 01:06:00,543
I think you are.

822
01:06:00,711 --> 01:06:01,920
Well, that's impossible

823
01:06:02,505 --> 01:06:03,755
because you're adopted,

824
01:06:03,839 --> 01:06:05,067
and I never slept with
your mother.

825
01:06:05,091 --> 01:06:06,693
- I wasn't adopted.
- What do you want from me?

826
01:06:06,717 --> 01:06:08,093
- Money?
- No, I don't...

827
01:06:08,177 --> 01:06:09,302
I wasn't adopted.

828
01:06:09,470 --> 01:06:11,262
Jesus. She never told you?

829
01:06:11,430 --> 01:06:13,098
Told me what?

830
01:06:14,433 --> 01:06:16,411
Your mother adopted you
while she was working for us.

831
01:06:16,435 --> 01:06:17,644
That's not true.

832
01:06:18,187 --> 01:06:19,187
Why are you saying that?

833
01:06:19,355 --> 01:06:20,415
Then she was arrested
and committed

834
01:06:20,439 --> 01:06:21,606
to Arkham State Hospital,

835
01:06:21,774 --> 01:06:23,149
when you were just a little boy.

836
01:06:23,317 --> 01:06:24,442
Why are you saying this?

837
01:06:24,610 --> 01:06:26,111
I don't need you to
tell me lies.

838
01:06:26,278 --> 01:06:27,612
I know it seems strange.

839
01:06:27,697 --> 01:06:29,322
I don't mean to
make you uncomfortable.

840
01:06:29,490 --> 01:06:31,074
I don't know
why everyone is so rude.

841
01:06:31,242 --> 01:06:32,450
I don't know why you are.

842
01:06:32,618 --> 01:06:33,952
I don't want anything from you.

843
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:36,496
Maybe a little bit of warmth,
maybe a hug, Dad!

844
01:06:36,664 --> 01:06:38,665
How about just a little bit
of fucking decency?

845
01:06:38,833 --> 01:06:40,208
What is it with you people?

846
01:06:40,376 --> 01:06:42,335
You say that stuff
about my mother.

847
01:06:42,503 --> 01:06:43,878
She's crazy.

848
01:06:43,963 --> 01:06:46,047
She's...

849
01:06:53,639 --> 01:06:55,014
You think this is funny?

850
01:06:56,642 --> 01:06:59,811
Dad, it's me. Come on.

851
01:07:02,523 --> 01:07:03,690
Touch my son again,

852
01:07:03,774 --> 01:07:05,214
I'll fucking kill you.

853
01:07:25,087 --> 01:07:27,881
Hello, Mr. Fleck.
This is Detective Garrity.

854
01:07:28,048 --> 01:07:30,383
We met the other night
at Gotham General.

855
01:07:30,551 --> 01:07:32,844
My partner and I had a few
more questions for you.

856
01:07:33,012 --> 01:07:35,930
We stopped by your apartment
today, but you weren't home.

857
01:07:36,098 --> 01:07:37,978
Please give me a call
when you get this message.

858
01:07:38,017 --> 01:07:39,934
Again, Detective Garrity,

859
01:07:40,102 --> 01:07:44,105
and my number is 212... 99.

860
01:08:27,149 --> 01:08:28,983
This message is
for Arthur Fleck.

861
01:08:29,151 --> 01:08:30,860
My name is Shirley Woods.

862
01:08:30,945 --> 01:08:33,112
I work on
The Murray Franklin Show.

863
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:34,424
I don't know if you're aware,

864
01:08:34,448 --> 01:08:36,048
but Murray played
a clip of your stand-up

865
01:08:36,075 --> 01:08:37,116
on the show recently,

866
01:08:37,284 --> 01:08:40,578
and we have gotten an amazing
response from our viewers.

867
01:08:40,746 --> 01:08:42,956
Murray asked me to give you
a call and see if you're...

868
01:08:47,378 --> 01:08:48,711
Who is this?

869
01:08:48,879 --> 01:08:50,505
Oh, hi, this is Shirley Woods.

870
01:08:50,673 --> 01:08:53,466
I'm the show Booker from
Live with Murray Franklin.

871
01:08:53,634 --> 01:08:54,676
Is this Arthur?

872
01:08:56,679 --> 01:08:57,679
Yes.

873
01:08:57,847 --> 01:08:59,806
Hi, Arthur.
Well, as I was saying,

874
01:08:59,890 --> 01:09:01,891
we've gotten a lot of calls
about your clip.

875
01:09:02,059 --> 01:09:03,768
Amazing responses.

876
01:09:03,936 --> 01:09:06,229
And Murray asked
if I would reach out to you

877
01:09:06,313 --> 01:09:07,939
to see if you would
come on as his guest.

878
01:09:13,237 --> 01:09:16,364
Murray wants me
on The Murray Franklin Show?

879
01:09:16,532 --> 01:09:18,116
Yeah. Isn't that great?

880
01:09:18,284 --> 01:09:21,160
He'd love to talk to you,
maybe do some of your act?

881
01:09:22,162 --> 01:09:24,330
That sound good to you?

882
01:09:28,669 --> 01:09:30,712
Yeah, that sounds great.

883
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:32,714
Can we set up a date right now?

884
01:09:32,798 --> 01:09:34,507
Are you available next Thursday?

885
01:10:27,227 --> 01:10:28,227
Hey.

886
01:10:29,063 --> 01:10:32,023
Man,
I'm sorry about that, my man.

887
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:34,461
All records 10 years or older,
they store in the basement,

888
01:10:34,485 --> 01:10:37,487
and you're talking about
something 30 years ago, so...

889
01:10:38,864 --> 01:10:40,823
Can I ask you a question?

890
01:10:40,991 --> 01:10:42,200
Sure.

891
01:10:42,785 --> 01:10:46,704
How does someone
wind up in here?

892
01:10:47,790 --> 01:10:51,292
Have they all, all the people
committed crimes?

893
01:10:51,919 --> 01:10:53,586
Well, yeah, some have.

894
01:10:53,754 --> 01:10:56,631
You know, some are just crazy.

895
01:10:56,799 --> 01:10:59,258
Pose dangers to
themselves and others.

896
01:10:59,426 --> 01:11:01,010
Some just got
nowhere else to go.

897
01:11:01,095 --> 01:11:03,179
Don't know what to do, you know?

898
01:11:03,347 --> 01:11:07,016
- Yeah. I hear you, brother.
- Hmm.

899
01:11:07,101 --> 01:11:09,936
Sometimes,
I don't know what to do.

900
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:14,148
Last time, I ended up taking
it out on some people.

901
01:11:15,609 --> 01:11:19,237
I thought it was gonna bother
me, but it really hasn't.

902
01:11:20,572 --> 01:11:21,572
What's that?

903
01:11:23,117 --> 01:11:26,494
I fucked up and
did some bad shit.

904
01:11:30,416 --> 01:11:31,601
You know what I'm talking about,

905
01:11:31,625 --> 01:11:36,963
it's so hard to just try and
be happy all the time.

906
01:11:39,049 --> 01:11:40,758
Hey, listen, man.

907
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:43,219
I'm just
an administrative assistant.

908
01:11:43,303 --> 01:11:44,804
Like a clerk, you know.

909
01:11:44,972 --> 01:11:46,556
All I do is file paperwork.

910
01:11:47,683 --> 01:11:49,392
I don't know what to tell you.

911
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:52,752
But you should see somebody.
You know, they got programs,

912
01:11:52,855 --> 01:11:55,398
city services, stuff like that.

913
01:11:55,566 --> 01:11:56,899
Oh, yeah.

914
01:11:56,984 --> 01:11:58,664
They cut all those.

915
01:12:03,657 --> 01:12:05,658
All right, here it is.
Fleck.

916
01:12:05,826 --> 01:12:07,744
Penny Fleck. Let's see.

917
01:12:08,662 --> 01:12:12,248
Diagnosed by
Dr. Benjamin Stoner.

918
01:12:13,792 --> 01:12:17,837
Oh. "The patient suffers
from delusional psychosis

919
01:12:18,005 --> 01:12:21,466
and narcissistic
personality disorder." Mmm.

920
01:12:22,051 --> 01:12:23,760
"Was found guilty of endangering

921
01:12:23,844 --> 01:12:27,263
the welfare
of her own child."

922
01:12:35,564 --> 01:12:36,564
What?

923
01:12:39,985 --> 01:12:41,444
You said she's your mother.

924
01:12:46,408 --> 01:12:47,533
Uh...

925
01:12:47,743 --> 01:12:50,119
I'm sorry, man. Like I said,
I can't release these records,

926
01:12:50,287 --> 01:12:53,039
you know, without proper forms.

927
01:12:53,499 --> 01:12:55,166
I could get in trouble.

928
01:12:55,959 --> 01:12:58,002
Look, if you want to bring
your mom in here to sign,

929
01:12:58,170 --> 01:12:59,170
that'll be much easier,

930
01:12:59,338 --> 01:13:02,381
but I can't let this go
without her signature, okay?

931
01:13:02,549 --> 01:13:03,549
I'm sorry.

932
01:13:07,721 --> 01:13:09,931
No, man! Shit!

933
01:13:10,516 --> 01:13:12,391
Come on, man. Give it...

934
01:13:13,310 --> 01:13:15,603
Hey! Hey!

935
01:14:13,787 --> 01:14:16,706
We went over this,
Penny. You adopted him.

936
01:14:17,416 --> 01:14:19,208
We have all the paperwork
right here.

937
01:14:19,918 --> 01:14:22,128
That's not true.

938
01:14:22,296 --> 01:14:24,547
Thomas had that all made up,

939
01:14:24,715 --> 01:14:27,341
so it stayed our secret.

940
01:14:29,261 --> 01:14:31,679
You also stood by

941
01:14:32,306 --> 01:14:33,639
while one of your boyfriends

942
01:14:33,724 --> 01:14:37,185
repeatedly abused
your adopted son

943
01:14:38,562 --> 01:14:39,562
and battered you.

944
01:14:59,333 --> 01:15:00,917
Penny,

945
01:15:01,501 --> 01:15:05,129
your son was found tied
to a radiator

946
01:15:05,297 --> 01:15:07,715
in your filthy apartment.

947
01:15:07,883 --> 01:15:10,384
Malnourished with multiple
bruises across his body

948
01:15:10,552 --> 01:15:12,553
and severe trauma to his head.

949
01:15:14,723 --> 01:15:16,432
I never heard him cry.

950
01:15:17,351 --> 01:15:20,811
He's always been
such a happy little boy.

951
01:17:21,892 --> 01:17:23,309
It's time for bed.

952
01:17:26,813 --> 01:17:27,813
Oh, my God!

953
01:17:28,774 --> 01:17:30,734
What are you doing in here?

954
01:17:32,986 --> 01:17:34,862
You're in the wrong apartment.

955
01:17:41,495 --> 01:17:43,204
Your name's Arthur, right?

956
01:17:43,830 --> 01:17:45,039
You live down the hall.

957
01:17:48,251 --> 01:17:50,044
I really need you to leave.

958
01:17:54,341 --> 01:17:57,301
My little girl is sleeping
in the other room.

959
01:18:02,432 --> 01:18:03,516
Please.

960
01:18:06,186 --> 01:18:08,437
I had a bad day.

961
01:18:11,274 --> 01:18:13,776
Can I call someone?
Is your mother home?

962
01:19:40,030 --> 01:19:41,739
Shut up!

963
01:20:00,926 --> 01:20:02,343
Hey, Penny.

964
01:20:04,804 --> 01:20:06,138
Penny Fleck.

965
01:20:14,314 --> 01:20:16,148
I always hated that name.

966
01:20:19,778 --> 01:20:21,695
You know how you used to tell me

967
01:20:23,740 --> 01:20:26,367
that my laugh was a condition?

968
01:20:27,911 --> 01:20:29,995
That there was
something wrong with me?

969
01:20:33,083 --> 01:20:34,291
There isn't.

970
01:20:37,170 --> 01:20:38,504
That's the real me.

971
01:20:39,339 --> 01:20:40,839
Happy.

972
01:20:43,051 --> 01:20:45,511
Happy. Hmm.

973
01:20:48,848 --> 01:20:51,642
I haven't been happy

974
01:20:51,726 --> 01:20:53,978
one minute of
my entire fucking life.

975
01:21:00,944 --> 01:21:02,361
You know what's funny?

976
01:21:05,115 --> 01:21:06,907
You know
what really makes me laugh?

977
01:21:09,286 --> 01:21:11,704
I used to think
that my life was a tragedy...

978
01:21:13,456 --> 01:21:15,457
But now I realize

979
01:21:15,625 --> 01:21:17,209
it's a fucking comedy.

980
01:22:27,739 --> 01:22:28,906
A very fine actor.

981
01:22:29,074 --> 01:22:32,076
He's got a new movie
called American Playboy

982
01:22:32,243 --> 01:22:34,119
opening this week
across the country.

983
01:22:34,287 --> 01:22:36,121
Will you please welcome
a good friend

984
01:22:36,206 --> 01:22:38,290
of the show, Mr. Ethan Chase.

985
01:22:57,977 --> 01:22:59,830
Good to see you, Ethan.
You're looking great, Ethan.

986
01:22:59,854 --> 01:23:01,791
Thank you very much.
You're looking good yourself.

987
01:23:01,815 --> 01:23:02,935
Ah, can't complain.

988
01:23:03,316 --> 01:23:05,609
Hey, Murray.
Thanks so much for having...

989
01:23:06,945 --> 01:23:07,986
Hey, Murray.

990
01:23:08,154 --> 01:23:10,155
Thank you so much for
having me on the show.

991
01:23:10,740 --> 01:23:12,866
It's been
a lifelong dream of mine.

992
01:23:15,161 --> 01:23:16,401
I'm nervous right now.

993
01:23:18,164 --> 01:23:19,844
- You are?
- I am nervous.

994
01:23:20,417 --> 01:23:21,959
Hey, Murray. I've been on...

995
01:23:35,390 --> 01:23:36,849
I'm sorry. What's that?

996
01:23:38,226 --> 01:23:40,018
Oh, that's very funny, Murray.

997
01:23:41,312 --> 01:23:43,480
You know, I'm also a comedian.

998
01:23:43,648 --> 01:23:44,940
Would you like to hear a joke?

999
01:23:46,151 --> 01:23:48,360
Yeah? All of you?

1000
01:23:48,862 --> 01:23:49,862
Okay.

1001
01:23:52,907 --> 01:23:53,991
Knock...

1002
01:23:54,075 --> 01:23:55,200
Knock, knock.

1003
01:24:09,090 --> 01:24:10,382
Knock, knock.

1004
01:24:31,321 --> 01:24:32,488
That's life

1005
01:24:32,572 --> 01:24:34,281
That's life

1006
01:24:34,365 --> 01:24:37,284
That's what all the people say

1007
01:24:38,703 --> 01:24:41,580
You're riding high in April

1008
01:24:41,664 --> 01:24:44,333
Shot down in May

1009
01:24:44,417 --> 01:24:49,087
But I know I'm gonna change that tune

1010
01:24:50,632 --> 01:24:55,260
When I'm back on top
Back on top in June

1011
01:24:55,845 --> 01:24:58,263
I said, that's life

1012
01:24:58,348 --> 01:25:00,390
That's life

1013
01:25:00,475 --> 01:25:03,685
And as funny as it may seem

1014
01:25:04,395 --> 01:25:06,730
Some people get their kicks

1015
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:10,108
Stompin' on a dream

1016
01:25:10,860 --> 01:25:14,613
But I don't let it,
let it get me down

1017
01:25:16,407 --> 01:25:18,742
'Cause this fine old world

1018
01:25:18,827 --> 01:25:21,328
It keeps spinnin' around

1019
01:25:22,163 --> 01:25:25,415
I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate

1020
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:29,002
A poet, a pawn and a king

1021
01:25:29,087 --> 01:25:33,131
I've been up and down and over and out

1022
01:25:33,216 --> 01:25:35,342
And I know one thing

1023
01:25:35,426 --> 01:25:41,056
Each time I find myself flat on my face

1024
01:25:42,058 --> 01:25:48,230
I pick myself up
And get back in the race

1025
01:25:48,314 --> 01:25:49,439
That's life

1026
01:25:49,524 --> 01:25:51,204
That's life

1027
01:25:51,276 --> 01:25:54,152
I tell ya, I can't deny it

1028
01:25:55,738 --> 01:25:57,614
I thought of quitting, baby

1029
01:25:58,867 --> 01:26:01,410
But my heart just ain't gonna buy it

1030
01:26:01,494 --> 01:26:04,955
And if I didn't think
It was worth one single try

1031
01:26:07,709 --> 01:26:08,792
Coming.

1032
01:26:08,877 --> 01:26:12,421
I'd jump right on a big bird
And then I'd fly...

1033
01:26:19,888 --> 01:26:21,305
Hey, Arthur.

1034
01:26:21,472 --> 01:26:22,472
How's it going?

1035
01:26:23,474 --> 01:26:24,766
Oh, hey, guys.

1036
01:26:25,310 --> 01:26:26,435
Come on in.

1037
01:26:26,895 --> 01:26:28,020
Did you get a new gig?

1038
01:26:28,730 --> 01:26:29,730
No.

1039
01:26:30,648 --> 01:26:33,692
Oh, you must be going down to
that rally at City Hall.

1040
01:26:33,860 --> 01:26:35,527
I hear it's gonna be nuts.

1041
01:26:35,695 --> 01:26:37,279
Oh, is that today?

1042
01:26:37,989 --> 01:26:38,989
Yeah.

1043
01:26:39,908 --> 01:26:41,325
What's with the makeup then?

1044
01:26:42,785 --> 01:26:44,286
My mom died.

1045
01:26:44,454 --> 01:26:45,662
I'm celebrating.

1046
01:26:46,581 --> 01:26:47,581
Right. We heard.

1047
01:26:47,749 --> 01:26:48,790
That's why we came by.

1048
01:26:48,958 --> 01:26:51,668
We figured, you know, you
could use some cheering up.

1049
01:26:52,211 --> 01:26:53,837
Aw, that's sweet.

1050
01:26:54,005 --> 01:26:56,882
But, no, I feel good.

1051
01:26:57,675 --> 01:26:59,301
Yeah, I stopped
taking my medication.

1052
01:26:59,469 --> 01:27:01,094
I feel a lot better now.

1053
01:27:03,222 --> 01:27:05,724
Oh, okay. Good for you.

1054
01:27:07,852 --> 01:27:10,729
So, hey, listen,
I don't know if you heard,

1055
01:27:10,897 --> 01:27:13,315
but the cops have been coming
around the shop,

1056
01:27:14,067 --> 01:27:17,986
talking to all the guys
about those subway murders.

1057
01:27:18,112 --> 01:27:19,905
- And, um...
- They didn't talk to me.

1058
01:27:21,866 --> 01:27:24,534
That's because the suspect
was a regular-sized person.

1059
01:27:25,078 --> 01:27:27,579
If it was a fucking midget,
you'd be in jail right now.

1060
01:27:33,378 --> 01:27:34,628
Anyway, um,

1061
01:27:34,796 --> 01:27:38,799
Hoyt said
that they talked to you,

1062
01:27:38,967 --> 01:27:40,258
and now they're looking for me,

1063
01:27:40,343 --> 01:27:41,927
and I just wanna know
what you said.

1064
01:27:42,095 --> 01:27:43,512
Make sure our stories line up.

1065
01:27:43,680 --> 01:27:46,723
- Seeing as how you're my boy.
- Yeah, that's important.

1066
01:27:46,891 --> 01:27:48,702
- That makes a lot of sense.
- You know what I mean?

1067
01:27:48,726 --> 01:27:50,394
Thank you, Randall.
Thank you so much.

1068
01:27:56,192 --> 01:27:57,192
Arthur!

1069
01:27:57,860 --> 01:27:59,194
No!

1070
01:28:00,530 --> 01:28:01,530
What?

1071
01:28:02,865 --> 01:28:03,865
No!

1072
01:28:11,791 --> 01:28:13,875
Why would you do that, Arthur?

1073
01:28:34,939 --> 01:28:37,107
Do you watch
The Murray Franklin Show?

1074
01:28:37,191 --> 01:28:38,608
Yeah.

1075
01:28:39,944 --> 01:28:41,737
I'm gonna be on tonight.

1076
01:28:46,034 --> 01:28:47,784
It fucking crazy, innit?

1077
01:28:47,869 --> 01:28:49,703
Me on the telly.

1078
01:28:51,748 --> 01:28:53,707
What the fuck, Arthur?

1079
01:28:54,959 --> 01:28:56,043
What?

1080
01:29:01,049 --> 01:29:02,257
It's okay, Gary.

1081
01:29:02,717 --> 01:29:03,717
You can go.

1082
01:29:06,304 --> 01:29:07,929
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1083
01:29:10,892 --> 01:29:12,350
Oh!

1084
01:29:12,602 --> 01:29:14,686
Don't look. Just go.

1085
01:29:27,241 --> 01:29:28,241
Fuck.

1086
01:29:33,539 --> 01:29:34,706
Hey, Arthur?

1087
01:29:34,874 --> 01:29:35,874
Yeah?

1088
01:29:37,085 --> 01:29:39,503
Arthur, can you get the lock?

1089
01:29:42,715 --> 01:29:43,715
Shit.

1090
01:29:44,175 --> 01:29:45,634
Sorry, Gary.

1091
01:29:56,604 --> 01:29:57,646
Gary?

1092
01:29:57,814 --> 01:29:58,814
Yeah.

1093
01:30:01,359 --> 01:30:03,944
You were the only one
that was ever nice to me.

1094
01:30:06,030 --> 01:30:07,239
Skedaddle.

1095
01:31:34,452 --> 01:31:35,785
Hey, Arthur!

1096
01:31:35,953 --> 01:31:37,329
We need to talk.

1097
01:31:37,580 --> 01:31:38,705
Oh!

1098
01:31:38,789 --> 01:31:40,790
Hey! Stop, Arthur!

1099
01:31:46,214 --> 01:31:47,297
Arthur!

1100
01:31:49,884 --> 01:31:51,509
Watch it!
Out of the way!

1101
01:31:54,680 --> 01:31:55,680
Move!

1102
01:31:57,683 --> 01:31:58,723
Arthur!

1103
01:31:59,727 --> 01:32:00,977
Shit.

1104
01:32:03,356 --> 01:32:04,439
Hey! Hey!

1105
01:32:11,489 --> 01:32:12,489
Arthur, stop!

1106
01:32:18,204 --> 01:32:19,204
Go! Go!

1107
01:32:21,332 --> 01:32:23,332
Now
departing, O-Train, downtown.

1108
01:32:25,169 --> 01:32:26,920
Stand clear of
the closing doors.

1109
01:32:36,347 --> 01:32:38,974
Hold that train! Hold it!

1110
01:32:40,893 --> 01:32:42,102
Get out! Get outta here!

1111
01:32:43,229 --> 01:32:44,869
Next stop, Bedford Park.

1112
01:32:59,245 --> 01:33:00,245
Masks off!

1113
01:33:00,413 --> 01:33:01,788
Get your mask off!

1114
01:33:02,623 --> 01:33:04,374
Signs down! Now!

1115
01:33:13,551 --> 01:33:15,010
Police! Signs down!

1116
01:33:16,178 --> 01:33:17,262
Signs down.

1117
01:33:21,976 --> 01:33:23,143
What the fuck!

1118
01:33:26,063 --> 01:33:27,623
Beat his ass!

1119
01:33:33,988 --> 01:33:35,530
Stop fighting! Police!

1120
01:33:35,698 --> 01:33:37,824
Police! Get down!

1121
01:33:39,994 --> 01:33:42,120
Get down! Get the fuck back!

1122
01:33:43,205 --> 01:33:44,205
Police! Get down.

1123
01:33:45,124 --> 01:33:46,249
Get the fuck down!

1124
01:33:50,963 --> 01:33:53,381
Stay the fuck back! Down!

1125
01:33:57,011 --> 01:33:58,011
What the...

1126
01:34:01,390 --> 01:34:02,390
Arthur!

1127
01:34:02,975 --> 01:34:04,017
Burke!

1128
01:34:05,644 --> 01:34:07,103
Don't do it!

1129
01:34:56,946 --> 01:34:58,113
Two officers on the train

1130
01:34:58,197 --> 01:34:59,717
were violently confronted
by the crowd,

1131
01:34:59,782 --> 01:35:01,199
and tonight are in serious

1132
01:35:01,283 --> 01:35:03,493
but stable condition
at Gotham Metropolitan.

1133
01:35:03,577 --> 01:35:05,161
We're going live now to

1134
01:35:05,246 --> 01:35:07,038
co-anchor Courtney Weathers,

1135
01:35:07,206 --> 01:35:09,206
who's standing by outside
the Bedford Park Station,

1136
01:35:09,291 --> 01:35:11,126
near where the shooting
took place.

1137
01:35:11,293 --> 01:35:13,169
Courtney,
what's the scene there?

1138
01:35:18,175 --> 01:35:19,217
Murray.

1139
01:35:19,385 --> 01:35:20,969
Hey, hey, hey.
It's Mr. Franklin, buddy.

1140
01:35:21,137 --> 01:35:23,513
Oh, come on, Gene.
That's all bullshit.

1141
01:35:24,598 --> 01:35:25,807
Thank you, Murray.

1142
01:35:27,017 --> 01:35:28,768
I feel like I know you.

1143
01:35:29,270 --> 01:35:31,104
I've been watching you forever.

1144
01:35:31,272 --> 01:35:32,397
Thank you.

1145
01:35:32,565 --> 01:35:33,857
What's with the face?

1146
01:35:34,024 --> 01:35:35,984
I mean,
are you part of the protest?

1147
01:35:36,152 --> 01:35:37,152
No.

1148
01:35:37,319 --> 01:35:39,070
No, I don't believe
in any of that.

1149
01:35:39,780 --> 01:35:41,364
I don't believe in anything.

1150
01:35:41,991 --> 01:35:43,533
I just thought
it'd be good for my act.

1151
01:35:43,701 --> 01:35:45,201
For your act? Didn't you hear

1152
01:35:45,286 --> 01:35:46,763
what happened on the subway?
Some clown got killed.

1153
01:35:46,787 --> 01:35:48,473
He's aware of that.
He's aware of that. Yeah.

1154
01:35:48,497 --> 01:35:49,747
No, I hadn't heard.

1155
01:35:50,207 --> 01:35:51,291
- Yeah.
- You see?

1156
01:35:51,375 --> 01:35:52,769
This is what I'm telling you.
The audience is gonna go crazy

1157
01:35:52,793 --> 01:35:53,793
if you put this guy on.

1158
01:35:53,919 --> 01:35:56,045
Maybe for a bit,
but not a whole segment.

1159
01:35:56,213 --> 01:35:58,423
Gene, it's gonna work.
It's gonna work.

1160
01:35:59,216 --> 01:36:01,296
We're gonna go with it.

1161
01:36:01,552 --> 01:36:02,552
Thank you, Murray.

1162
01:36:03,137 --> 01:36:04,262
Couple rules, though.

1163
01:36:04,430 --> 01:36:06,181
No cursing.
No off-color material.

1164
01:36:06,348 --> 01:36:07,807
We do a clean show.

1165
01:36:07,975 --> 01:36:08,975
- Okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

1166
01:36:09,143 --> 01:36:10,727
You'll go on
right after Dr. Sally.

1167
01:36:10,895 --> 01:36:11,895
I love Dr. Sally.

1168
01:36:12,062 --> 01:36:13,480
Good, good. Someone will

1169
01:36:13,564 --> 01:36:15,732
- come and get you, okay?
- Okay. Perfect.

1170
01:36:15,816 --> 01:36:16,941
Good luck.

1171
01:36:17,026 --> 01:36:18,026
- Thanks, Murray.
- Okay.

1172
01:36:19,236 --> 01:36:22,447
- Murray, one small thing.
- Yeah.

1173
01:36:22,615 --> 01:36:24,282
When you bring me out,

1174
01:36:24,450 --> 01:36:26,326
can you introduce me as Joker?

1175
01:36:26,494 --> 01:36:28,203
What's wrong
with your real name?

1176
01:36:28,829 --> 01:36:31,080
That's what you called me
on the show.

1177
01:36:31,248 --> 01:36:32,373
A joker.

1178
01:36:32,541 --> 01:36:33,541
Do you remember?

1179
01:36:33,918 --> 01:36:35,919
- Did I?
- I don't know.

1180
01:36:36,086 --> 01:36:38,171
Well, if you say so, kid,
you know, Joker it is.

1181
01:36:38,339 --> 01:36:39,339
It's good.

1182
01:36:39,507 --> 01:36:40,590
Thanks, Murray.

1183
01:37:02,863 --> 01:37:03,965
I'll try it, you know,

1184
01:37:03,989 --> 01:37:05,865
but I'm not sure
my wife will let me do it.

1185
01:37:07,326 --> 01:37:08,660
Maybe my next wife.

1186
01:37:12,373 --> 01:37:14,123
You gotta see
our next guest for yourself.

1187
01:37:14,291 --> 01:37:16,334
I'm pretty sure
this guy could use a doctor.

1188
01:37:16,669 --> 01:37:17,729
Oh!

1189
01:37:17,753 --> 01:37:19,128
Does he have sexual problems?

1190
01:37:19,296 --> 01:37:21,714
Oh, he looks like
he's got a lot of problems.

1191
01:37:22,925 --> 01:37:25,552
All right, Bobby, let's show
that clip one last time.

1192
01:37:31,976 --> 01:37:34,852
I hated school as a kid.

1193
01:37:36,647 --> 01:37:38,815
But my mother would always say,

1194
01:37:39,858 --> 01:37:41,169
"You should enjoy it.

1195
01:37:41,193 --> 01:37:44,320
One day, you'll have to
work for a living."

1196
01:37:44,488 --> 01:37:45,715
"No, I won't, Ma.

1197
01:37:45,739 --> 01:37:47,699
I'm gonna be a comedian."

1198
01:37:53,998 --> 01:37:56,291
Okay. You may...

1199
01:37:57,751 --> 01:38:01,004
You may have seen that clip
of our next guest.

1200
01:38:01,171 --> 01:38:03,548
Now, before he comes out,
I just want to say

1201
01:38:03,716 --> 01:38:05,216
that we're all heartbroken

1202
01:38:05,301 --> 01:38:07,260
about what's going on
in the city tonight.

1203
01:38:07,428 --> 01:38:09,721
But this is
how he wanted to come out,

1204
01:38:09,888 --> 01:38:13,099
and honestly, I think
we could all use a good laugh.

1205
01:38:13,267 --> 01:38:15,435
So, please welcome, Joker.

1206
01:38:24,101 --> 01:38:33,349
Find the official YIFY movies site at
https://YTS.LT

1207
01:38:58,062 --> 01:38:59,437
Are you all right, Doctor?

1208
01:39:03,275 --> 01:39:05,735
Well,
that was quite an entrance.

1209
01:39:12,284 --> 01:39:13,284
You okay?

1210
01:39:16,121 --> 01:39:17,538
Yeah.

1211
01:39:17,706 --> 01:39:20,416
This is exactly
how I imagined it.

1212
01:39:22,378 --> 01:39:24,170
Well, that makes one of us.

1213
01:39:31,053 --> 01:39:33,221
So, can you tell us
about this look?

1214
01:39:33,389 --> 01:39:34,722
When we spoke earlier,

1215
01:39:34,807 --> 01:39:36,910
you mentioned that this look
is not a political statement.

1216
01:39:36,934 --> 01:39:37,975
Is that right?

1217
01:39:38,143 --> 01:39:39,769
That's right, Murray.
I'm not political.

1218
01:39:39,937 --> 01:39:42,480
I'm just trying to
make people laugh.

1219
01:39:42,648 --> 01:39:44,728
And how's that going for you?

1220
01:39:52,741 --> 01:39:54,575
So, I know you're a comedian.

1221
01:39:54,743 --> 01:39:56,577
You been working on
any new material?

1222
01:39:56,662 --> 01:39:57,787
You wanna tell us a joke?

1223
01:40:03,502 --> 01:40:04,502
Yeah?

1224
01:40:06,672 --> 01:40:07,672
Okay.

1225
01:40:13,721 --> 01:40:15,346
He's got a book.

1226
01:40:16,265 --> 01:40:17,724
A book of jokes.

1227
01:40:27,568 --> 01:40:28,943
Take your time.
We got all night.

1228
01:40:34,992 --> 01:40:37,285
Okay, okay. Here's one.

1229
01:40:40,414 --> 01:40:42,915
Knock, knock.

1230
01:40:43,083 --> 01:40:44,417
And you had to look that up?

1231
01:40:51,550 --> 01:40:53,176
I want to get it right.

1232
01:40:55,012 --> 01:40:56,554
Knock, knock.

1233
01:40:56,722 --> 01:40:58,222
Who's there?

1234
01:40:59,683 --> 01:41:01,100
It's the police, ma'am.

1235
01:41:01,268 --> 01:41:03,102
Your son's been hit
by a drunk driver.

1236
01:41:03,270 --> 01:41:05,688
He's dead.

1237
01:41:07,608 --> 01:41:09,192
Oh, no, no, no.

1238
01:41:09,359 --> 01:41:11,110
No, you cannot joke about that.

1239
01:41:11,278 --> 01:41:13,237
Yeah, that's not funny, Arthur.

1240
01:41:13,405 --> 01:41:15,865
That's not the kind of humor
we do on this show.

1241
01:41:16,450 --> 01:41:18,743
Okay. I'm... Yeah, I'm sorry.

1242
01:41:18,911 --> 01:41:23,289
It's just, you know, it's been
a rough few weeks, Murray.

1243
01:41:24,875 --> 01:41:26,709
Ever since

1244
01:41:29,254 --> 01:41:31,380
I killed
those three Wall Street guys.

1245
01:41:37,971 --> 01:41:39,931
Okay, I'm waiting
for the punchline.

1246
01:41:41,433 --> 01:41:43,142
There is no punchline.

1247
01:41:44,561 --> 01:41:46,437
It's not a joke.

1248
01:41:51,109 --> 01:41:52,193
You're serious, aren't you?

1249
01:41:52,361 --> 01:41:53,421
You're telling us you killed

1250
01:41:53,445 --> 01:41:54,714
those three young men
on the subway?

1251
01:41:54,738 --> 01:41:55,738
Mmm-hmm.

1252
01:41:55,906 --> 01:41:57,615
And why should we believe you?

1253
01:41:57,783 --> 01:41:59,742
I got nothing left to lose.

1254
01:42:01,745 --> 01:42:03,788
Nothing can hurt me anymore.

1255
01:42:06,959 --> 01:42:09,836
My life is nothing but a comedy.

1256
01:42:13,465 --> 01:42:14,567
Well, let me get this straight,

1257
01:42:14,591 --> 01:42:16,843
you think that killing
those guys is funny?

1258
01:42:17,511 --> 01:42:19,011
I do.

1259
01:42:19,179 --> 01:42:21,806
And I'm tired
of pretending it's not.

1260
01:42:21,974 --> 01:42:23,850
Comedy is subjective, Murray.

1261
01:42:24,309 --> 01:42:26,018
Isn't that what they say?

1262
01:42:26,186 --> 01:42:27,937
All of you,

1263
01:42:28,105 --> 01:42:30,690
the system that knows so much,

1264
01:42:30,858 --> 01:42:33,568
you decide
what's right or wrong.

1265
01:42:33,735 --> 01:42:38,948
The same way that you decide
what's funny or not!

1266
01:42:40,284 --> 01:42:41,284
Get him off!

1267
01:42:42,035 --> 01:42:45,705
Well, okay,
I think I might understand

1268
01:42:46,039 --> 01:42:47,540
that you did this to
start a movement,

1269
01:42:47,624 --> 01:42:49,625
to become a symbol?

1270
01:42:50,252 --> 01:42:51,794
Come on, Murray.

1271
01:42:51,962 --> 01:42:53,189
Do I look like the kind of clown

1272
01:42:53,213 --> 01:42:54,797
that could start a movement?

1273
01:42:54,965 --> 01:42:57,800
I killed those guys
because they were awful.

1274
01:42:57,968 --> 01:43:00,469
Everybody is awful these days.

1275
01:43:00,637 --> 01:43:02,930
It's enough to
make anyone crazy.

1276
01:43:03,098 --> 01:43:04,849
Okay. So, that's it,
you're crazy.

1277
01:43:05,017 --> 01:43:07,310
That's your defense
for killing three young men?

1278
01:43:07,936 --> 01:43:09,478
No.

1279
01:43:09,646 --> 01:43:12,982
They couldn't carry a tune
to save their lives.

1280
01:43:14,818 --> 01:43:18,237
Oh, why is everybody
so upset about these guys?

1281
01:43:19,114 --> 01:43:20,865
If it was me
dying on the sidewalk,

1282
01:43:20,949 --> 01:43:22,325
you'd walk right over me!

1283
01:43:22,492 --> 01:43:24,619
I pass you every day,
and you don't notice me.

1284
01:43:24,786 --> 01:43:27,038
But these guys, what,
because Thomas Wayne

1285
01:43:27,122 --> 01:43:28,664
went and cried about them on TV?

1286
01:43:28,832 --> 01:43:30,875
You have a problem
with Thomas Wayne, too?

1287
01:43:31,043 --> 01:43:32,960
Yes, I do.

1288
01:43:33,128 --> 01:43:36,547
Have you seen what it's like
out there, Murray?

1289
01:43:36,715 --> 01:43:39,759
Do you ever actually
leave the studio?

1290
01:43:39,927 --> 01:43:43,763
Everybody just yells
and screams at each other.

1291
01:43:43,931 --> 01:43:46,098
Nobody's civil anymore.

1292
01:43:46,266 --> 01:43:49,852
Nobody thinks what it's like
to be the other guy.

1293
01:43:50,646 --> 01:43:53,439
You think men like
Thomas Wayne ever think

1294
01:43:53,523 --> 01:43:55,483
what it's like to be
someone like me?

1295
01:43:55,651 --> 01:43:58,361
To be somebody but themselves?
They don't.

1296
01:43:58,570 --> 01:44:00,696
They think that
we'll just sit there

1297
01:44:00,781 --> 01:44:03,157
and take it,
like good little boys!

1298
01:44:03,450 --> 01:44:05,534
That we won't werewolf
and go wild!

1299
01:44:05,702 --> 01:44:07,328
You finished?

1300
01:44:07,496 --> 01:44:09,830
I mean, it's so much
self-pity, Arthur.

1301
01:44:09,998 --> 01:44:11,540
You sound like
you're making excuses

1302
01:44:11,625 --> 01:44:13,042
for killing those young men.

1303
01:44:13,210 --> 01:44:15,044
Not everybody,
and I'll tell you this,

1304
01:44:15,128 --> 01:44:16,545
not everyone is awful.

1305
01:44:18,840 --> 01:44:20,049
You're awful, Murray.

1306
01:44:20,217 --> 01:44:22,093
Me? I'm awful?

1307
01:44:22,260 --> 01:44:24,011
Oh, yeah, how am I awful?

1308
01:44:26,181 --> 01:44:27,640
Playing my video.

1309
01:44:29,059 --> 01:44:30,935
Inviting me on this show.

1310
01:44:32,020 --> 01:44:34,355
You just wanted to
make fun of me.

1311
01:44:35,357 --> 01:44:37,316
You're just like
the rest of them.

1312
01:44:37,484 --> 01:44:39,402
You don't know
the first thing about me, pal.

1313
01:44:39,569 --> 01:44:42,154
Look what happened, because of
what you did. What it led to.

1314
01:44:42,322 --> 01:44:44,031
There are riots out there.

1315
01:44:44,199 --> 01:44:45,718
Two policemen are
in critical condition,

1316
01:44:45,742 --> 01:44:47,011
and you're laughing.

1317
01:44:47,035 --> 01:44:48,035
You're laughing.

1318
01:44:48,203 --> 01:44:51,038
Someone was killed today,
because of what you did.

1319
01:44:51,206 --> 01:44:52,665
I know.

1320
01:44:55,252 --> 01:44:56,492
How about another joke, Murray?

1321
01:44:56,628 --> 01:44:58,308
No, I think we've had
enough of your jokes.

1322
01:44:58,422 --> 01:44:59,774
- What do you get...
- I don't think so.

1323
01:44:59,798 --> 01:45:02,341
When you cross
a mentally-ill loner

1324
01:45:02,509 --> 01:45:04,927
with a society that abandons him

1325
01:45:05,012 --> 01:45:06,053
and treats him like trash?

1326
01:45:06,221 --> 01:45:07,221
Call the police, Gene!

1327
01:45:07,389 --> 01:45:08,825
- I'll tell you what you get!
- Call the police.

1328
01:45:08,849 --> 01:45:10,516
You get
what you fucking deserve!

1329
01:45:47,054 --> 01:45:50,181
Good night.
And always remember, that's...

1330
01:45:55,562 --> 01:45:56,812
Breaking news.

1331
01:45:56,980 --> 01:45:59,523
Popular TV talk show host,
Murray Franklin

1332
01:45:59,691 --> 01:46:01,961
was shot dead tonight on the
live telecast of his program.

1333
01:46:01,985 --> 01:46:04,278
The man who was
introduced by Franklin

1334
01:46:04,362 --> 01:46:07,239
as "Joker" is
currently under arrest.

1335
01:46:07,407 --> 01:46:09,992
Police led the suspect
handcuffed out of the studio.

1336
01:46:11,745 --> 01:46:14,288
Merely just a punchline
to a joke...

1337
01:46:14,456 --> 01:46:16,096
You get what you
deserve!

1338
01:46:16,208 --> 01:46:17,310
Looting and rioting

1339
01:46:17,334 --> 01:46:18,375
have intensified here...

1340
01:46:18,543 --> 01:46:20,021
...rioting
throughout the city.

1341
01:46:20,045 --> 01:46:21,355
...with a society
that abandons him

1342
01:46:21,379 --> 01:46:22,421
and treats him like trash?

1343
01:46:22,506 --> 01:46:23,775
This mob of clowns...

1344
01:46:23,799 --> 01:46:25,359
many wearing clown masks.

1345
01:46:27,260 --> 01:46:28,980
If it was me
dying on the sidewalk,

1346
01:46:29,012 --> 01:46:30,406
- you'd walk right over me.
- To all of

1347
01:46:30,430 --> 01:46:31,908
those who have been
ignored by the system.

1348
01:46:31,932 --> 01:46:33,201
And always remember,
that's life!

1349
01:46:33,225 --> 01:46:35,893
And as you see,
Gotham is burning.

1350
01:46:37,354 --> 01:46:41,524
In the white room
With black curtains near the station

1351
01:46:45,028 --> 01:46:49,990
Black roof country, no gold pavements
Tired starlings

1352
01:46:53,870 --> 01:46:56,705
Silver horses ran down moonbeams

1353
01:46:58,834 --> 01:47:00,876
In your dark eyes

1354
01:47:02,879 --> 01:47:08,968
Dawnlight smiles on you leaving
My contentment

1355
01:47:14,266 --> 01:47:18,269
I'll wait in this place
Where the sun never shines

1356
01:47:21,106 --> 01:47:24,275
Wait in this place

1357
01:47:24,359 --> 01:47:29,905
Where the shadows run from themselves

1358
01:47:31,116 --> 01:47:33,316
Stop laughing,
you freak! This isn't funny.

1359
01:47:33,743 --> 01:47:35,054
Yeah, the whole
fucking city's on fire

1360
01:47:35,078 --> 01:47:36,078
'cause of what you did.

1361
01:47:37,289 --> 01:47:39,582
All units,
fire reported, north of alley.

1362
01:47:39,666 --> 01:47:41,208
Code Four for medical.

1363
01:47:41,835 --> 01:47:43,294
I know.

1364
01:47:44,796 --> 01:47:46,797
Isn't it beautiful?

1365
01:49:29,276 --> 01:49:30,609
Go over there.

1366
01:49:48,503 --> 01:49:49,628
Hey, Wayne.

1367
01:49:50,588 --> 01:49:52,339
You get
what you fucking deserve.

1368
01:49:52,507 --> 01:49:53,632
No! Pal!

1369
01:50:34,424 --> 01:50:36,425
Come on, get up!

1370
01:50:36,593 --> 01:50:38,552
Come on, man, get up.

1371
01:53:17,754 --> 01:53:19,838
What's so funny?

1372
01:53:23,843 --> 01:53:25,427
Just thinking of a joke.

1373
01:53:44,614 --> 01:53:46,615
Do you want to tell it to me?

1374
01:53:52,789 --> 01:53:54,414
You wouldn't get it.

1375
01:54:06,469 --> 01:54:08,136
That's life

1376
01:54:08,221 --> 01:54:09,680
That's life

1377
01:54:09,764 --> 01:54:12,683
And as funny as it may seem

1378
01:54:14,143 --> 01:54:16,853
Some people get their kicks

1379
01:54:17,021 --> 01:54:19,147
Stompin' on a dream

1380
01:54:20,191 --> 01:54:23,860
But I don't let it,
let it get me down

1381
01:54:26,030 --> 01:54:28,198
'Cause this fine old world

1382
01:54:28,324 --> 01:54:30,909
It keeps spinnin' around

1383
01:54:31,661 --> 01:54:34,955
I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate

1384
01:54:35,039 --> 01:54:38,292
A poet, a pawn and a king

1385
01:54:38,376 --> 01:54:42,337
I've been up and down and over and out

1386
01:54:42,422 --> 01:54:44,590
And I know one thing

1387
01:54:44,924 --> 01:54:50,762
Each time I find myself flat on my face

1388
01:54:51,180 --> 01:54:57,227
I pick myself up
And get back in the race

1389
01:54:57,604 --> 01:54:58,812
That's life

1390
01:54:58,896 --> 01:54:59,980
That's life

1391
01:55:00,064 --> 01:55:04,109
That's life
And I can't deny it

1392
01:55:04,819 --> 01:55:10,073
Many times I thought of cuttin' out
But my heart won't buy it

1393
01:55:10,658 --> 01:55:15,245
But if there's nothing shakin'
Come here this July

1394
01:55:18,207 --> 01:55:24,379
I'm gonna roll myself up in a big ball

1395
01:55:24,881 --> 01:55:31,094
And die

1396
01:55:32,889 --> 01:55:38,727
My, my

1397
01:55:50,114 --> 01:55:52,616
Isn't it rich?

1398
01:55:54,952 --> 01:55:57,746
Are we a pair?

1399
01:55:59,791 --> 01:56:03,585
Me here at last on the ground

1400
01:56:03,836 --> 01:56:07,089
You in mid-air

1401
01:56:09,133 --> 01:56:13,762
Send in the clowns

1402
01:56:20,561 --> 01:56:23,105
Isn't it bliss?

1403
01:56:25,983 --> 01:56:29,319
Don't you approve?

1404
01:56:30,988 --> 01:56:34,658
One who keeps tearing around

1405
01:56:34,742 --> 01:56:38,912
One who can't move

1406
01:56:41,874 --> 01:56:47,087
Where are the clowns?

1407
01:56:48,381 --> 01:56:52,217
Send in the clowns

1408
01:56:53,177 --> 01:56:55,929
Just when I stopped

1409
01:56:57,432 --> 01:57:00,600
Opening doors

1410
01:57:02,353 --> 01:57:09,025
Finally knowing
The one that I wanted was yours

1411
01:57:11,154 --> 01:57:17,826
Making my entrance again
With my usual flair

1412
01:57:21,080 --> 01:57:26,042
Sure of my lines

1413
01:57:27,795 --> 01:57:32,758
No one is there

1414
01:57:40,141 --> 01:57:44,144
Don't you love farce?

1415
01:57:46,939 --> 01:57:49,983
My fault, I fear

1416
01:57:52,445 --> 01:57:56,490
I thought that you'd
want what I want

1417
01:57:56,574 --> 01:58:00,243
Sorry, my dear

1418
01:58:02,538 --> 01:58:07,209
But where are the clowns?

1419
01:58:09,545 --> 01:58:14,508
There ought to be clowns

1420
01:58:15,676 --> 01:58:22,641
Well, maybe next year
